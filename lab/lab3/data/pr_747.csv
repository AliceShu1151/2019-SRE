application-specific version details in addition to the platform,
system and JDK information always populated by the platform by
default."

Gradle and Android Gradle Plugin versions, as well as versions
of some Android SDK components."
2018-02-28T19:41:42Z,discuss,"This is going to make it easier for users to collect version
information when they file bugs, which apart from the general
UX improvement would also reduce turnaround time as it'll be
less likely that a necessary detail might need to be requested
from the user additionally."

and AboutPopup, which are the two sources of the version
information used by people when filing bugs."

We'd like to get a feeling of how we should proceed with this for Android Studio: either merging the EP into platform & cherry-picking as per this PR, or limiting this to AS only (will not be accessible from platform). Thanks!"
