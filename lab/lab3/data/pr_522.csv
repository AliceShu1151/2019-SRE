522,Add a way to skip git pre-commit and pre-push hooks (IDEA-115914)
2017-02-27T22:11:55Z,discuss,"Git supports a pre-commit and pre-push hooks that are executed
after a commit or a push accordingly (https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks).
Sometimes it's needed to skip the hooks and bypass the checks for them.
For that purpose git supports a parameter no-verify.
With that commit inside the git commit dialog a checkbox ""Skip hook"" will be
available if any of the repositories have a pre-commit hook installed.
Similar way in the push dialog it will be possible to bypass the
pre-push hook.
Options are not visible and not used when there's no such hooks installed."
2017-02-27T22:11:55Z,discuss,"Currently only local hooks (inside .git/hooks folder) are supported.
It doesn't support a new git configuration variable core.hooksPath
that allows customizing where the hook directory is (since git 2.9.0)."
2017-03-01T11:15:46Z,discuss,"Nice work! I don't see any serious issues with this pull request, so almost ready to merge."
2017-03-01T11:15:46Z,discuss,"However, we are not sure about the UI of the option: where should it be added and whether its selection should be preserved or not. So please share your use cases in the YouTrack ticket. Thanks."
2017-03-01T13:32:36Z,discuss,"@klikh thank you.
I shared my use cases and put them to the comments (https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-115914#tab=Comments).
Gave a better thought on the selection preserving and probably it makes more sense not to remember the selection to avoid accidental pushes without hooks verification.
I can remove the selection storing part from the commit if you agree. Any more concerns?"
2017-03-02T21:49:17Z,discuss,@klikh I noticed that the branch got conflicts with the upstream. So I repushed the branch again with the next changes:
2017-03-23T22:28:08Z,discuss,"It appears that there are more conflicts after my recent changes in master. Don't worry about them: I've already applied your changes to a private branch, and currently I'm making some small additional changes and they are passing review. So I'll resolve these conflicts on my own."
2017-03-23T22:36:16Z,discuss,Thank you! I've recently noticed the conflicts and was about to start fixing them. You are right on time :)
2017-03-31T22:42:21Z,discuss,The fix was merged manually with some cleanups and additional changes discussed in https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-115914. Thanks for your contribution!
