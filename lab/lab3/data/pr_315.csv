Thank you for the reminder. I sent it."
2015-10-27T13:54:35Z,discuss,Received. Thanks.
2016-03-01T09:37:10Z,discuss,you might want to i18n this
2016-03-01T09:38:19Z,discuss,formatting
2016-03-01T09:39:47Z,discuss,"hmmm, this signature (and naming) is suspicious, please review it"
2016-03-01T09:41:06Z,discuss,"you could import GroovyTokenTypes statically, to make it more readable"
2016-03-01T09:43:57Z,discuss,"the loop will get the parent, you should skip it here:
PsiElement parent = expression;
ad preferably move it to a separate method (though I'm sure there are helper methods for this already)"
2016-03-01T09:48:00Z,discuss,PsiType.BOOLEAN.isAssignableFrom(expression.getType()) ? (might need the nullcheck also)
2018-07-21T12:43:31Z,discuss,"@vladmm, please rebase the PR, cc @dovchinnikov."
2019-06-24T14:41:59Z,discuss,"The code is okay, but there are other boolean contexts such as assert statement or ternary expression. Support for all of them is needed before this could be merged."
2019-06-24T14:41:59Z,discuss,Please reopen the request once it is ready.
