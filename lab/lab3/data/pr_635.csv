635,Extends IdeaModuleBase to support jars
2017-10-04T00:16:11Z,discuss,"IdeaModuleBase already extends a file set that supports zips or directories as inputs. This changes it so if the output of the model is a .jar, it will use the zip code path. It's unfortunate that the ant base class has two variables and expects only one of them to be set."

Why do you need this? IdeaModuleBase describes location of module classes, and it's used to pack them into JARs to build IDE distribution (see org.jetbrains.intellij.build.impl.DistributionJARsBuilder). If it refers to a JAR file it means that that JAR file will be packed into another JAR file in IDE distribution and this won't work."
