2018-05-23T13:59:11Z,discuss,"Seeing the previous message, or even reusing it at least partially could be useful. With the default changed, people who find it useful will not have a message out of the box, and will need to go enable it first, while those who do not need it just type their own."
2018-05-23T13:59:11Z,discuss,"If you don¡¯t need this in any of your projects, configure the option in Default settings, so all your new project have this option enabled."
2018-05-23T17:18:23Z,discuss,@klikh My team dislike this default option because sometime forget to change commit message.
2018-05-23T17:41:45Z,discuss,Hi @klikh
2018-05-23T17:41:45Z,discuss,I think this problem is due to user error because position of commit message box is bad UI/UX.
2018-05-23T17:41:45Z,discuss,"When I open the commit dialog, I'll select the change file (top position). and review changes (bottom position), then click the commit button."
2018-05-23T17:41:45Z,discuss,If I do not forget to change the text. When I click on the text box. Selected text will be discarded. The message must be re-selected. It's not easy.
2018-05-23T17:41:45Z,discuss,"If the commit message box move to near commit button, it will reduce the problem."
2018-05-23T17:41:45Z,discuss,Hope you will review this case again.
2018-05-25T17:51:52Z,discuss,"Usually the commit message is considered as a very important part of the commit, so it is strange to forget to change it. Nevertheless, we are currently discussing a new layout of the commit dialog, so it may be changed in one of future releases."
2018-05-25T17:51:52Z,discuss,"Meanwhile your team members can change that option manually. If you create new projects frequently, you can even change the default value of option for new projects (File | Other Settings | Preferences for New Project...)."
