2013-02-06T14:18:10Z,discuss,"I would really appreciate a test. The logic looks correct to me, but it's rather convoluted, and it would be much easier to verify with a test."
2013-02-06T15:19:27Z,discuss,What is the best way to provide test: by comment or add it to pull request?
2013-02-06T15:22:32Z,discuss,Of course it's better to add it to the pull request.
