2018-07-23T14:21:26Z,discuss,Could you please fix UI issues:
2018-07-23T15:03:13Z,discuss,What is the picker for? People don't read the labels when they see the UI which they are used to (and the picker is used normally to choose a fully qualified class name).
2018-07-23T15:29:58Z,discuss,I'd suggest to stay with simple text field. Or please explain what you like in picker.
2018-07-24T10:23:26Z,discuss,"Done.
I replaced the Class Picker table with a text only table."
2018-07-24T12:37:44Z,discuss,"Moreover, it's probably better to have one text field ""exclude inner classes matching *Builder"", semicolon separated, like for file types:

What do you think?"
2018-07-24T12:53:36Z,discuss,Fix coming
2018-07-24T12:53:36Z,discuss,"I was working off an example I found in Run Configurations/Applet/Applet Parameters that inserts a dummy value.
AppletConfigurable"
2018-07-24T12:53:36Z,discuss,I later found another example that does it with a blank value and I already updated the pull request. I still need to handle ignore-empty-values-on-save though.
2018-07-24T12:53:36Z,discuss,"I was trying very hard to avoid this pattern. I don't like it very much. It requires the user to know what the delimiter is and makes it harder to remove entries. More chance for user error.
Personally, I like my original solution with a class picker best. It gives he user a good feeling that he didn't misspell the class name. It also sometimes highlights classes with similar names for example, while entering Builder, I might also decide to add BuilderFactory etc'
But since you feel strongly against that, I think a table is better than a text field."
2018-07-24T13:02:01Z,discuss,"I don't think that separator is a problem, see

Still now it's not evident that the table contains short names."
2018-07-24T13:17:42Z,discuss,"Yes, I know there's a bunch of places that use this pattern. I still don't like it. There's other places that could use a text field but use a table instead:"
2018-07-24T13:17:42Z,discuss,
2018-07-24T13:17:42Z,discuss,I really prefer a table.
2018-07-24T13:17:42Z,discuss,"Not sure what you mean. Is the ""Do not import inner classes for"" title not clear enough? What would you suggest I call it?"
2018-07-24T13:20:55Z,discuss,"""Exclude inner classes by short name"". I'd also align the table to the right so it's clear that it depends on the checkbox above"
2018-07-24T13:29:27Z,discuss,done & done
2018-07-25T12:40:20Z,discuss,Thanks. Merged manually with some small cosmetics changes (in code)
2018-07-25T12:57:45Z,discuss,"Cool, thanks for the review."
2018-07-25T14:49:16Z,discuss,"Thanks so much for doing this. This is a highly requested feature inside Google, it comes up on internal mailing lists every few months :)"
