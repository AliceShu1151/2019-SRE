2018-10-16T00:28:16Z,discuss,@vladsoroka looking a little bit more into how BaseGradleProjectResolverExtension#createModule works it seems that any ModuleData will always be a direct child of a ProjectData which will make the structure flatten. I was wondering if it makes sense to add some structure there instead of duplicating this logic here and potentially in ExternalProjectDataSelectorDialog (since it will be great to group modules there too to load/unload groups of modules). What do you think?

2018-10-25T08:22:27Z,discuss,We have plans to replace DataNode api with another api which will have db-like implementation under the hood with indexing and other facilities to address performance and usability issues of the external project model consumers.
