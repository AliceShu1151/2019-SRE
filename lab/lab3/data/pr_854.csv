854,[Decompiler] Fix short name imports shadowed by super inner classes (IDEA-196315)
2018-09-11T17:39:28Z,discuss,"Currently, decompiling the modified test class will result in the short names Builder and Entry incorrectly being used as both these imports will be shadowed. This PR adds a check to the import collector to see if a short name will be shadowed a super inner class and adjusts the import accordingly."
