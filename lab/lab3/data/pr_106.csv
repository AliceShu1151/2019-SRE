2013-10-14T15:45:45Z,discuss,Merged manually. Thanks!
2013-10-14T15:49:19Z,discuss,"Sorry, I've had to revert this. The new signature breaks the following pattern:
public class DeploymentConfigurationBase extends DeploymentConfiguration implements PersistentStateComponent {
@override
public PersistentStateComponent<?> getSerializer() {
return this;
}"
2013-10-14T15:49:19Z,discuss,"@nullable
@override
public Self getState() {
return (Self)this;
}"
2013-10-14T15:49:19Z,discuss,"@override
public void loadState(Self state) {
XmlSerializerUtil.copyBean(state, this);
}
}"
2013-10-15T10:40:27Z,discuss,"Ok, but I didn't find any usage of DeploymentConfigurationBase, it is need?
I find same problem in ServerConfigurationBase and I made simple fix."
2013-10-15T11:18:31Z,discuss,"I sent new PR #107. I didn't drop the DeploymentConfigurationBase just fixed it, but seems you can do it."
