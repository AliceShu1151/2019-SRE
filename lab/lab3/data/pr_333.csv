2015-12-09T16:10:40Z,discuss,"I think we're seeing this drastic difference in performance because we have 12-core machines and it's traversing a networked (but quite fast) file system for a few thousand output jars. We are also seeing similar performance gains in indexing by increasing the index thread count via a system property, so for us it's very nice to have the same characteristics here."
