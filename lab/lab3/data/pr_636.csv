636,"IDEA-180073 PlatformTestCase fails with ""Code style settings damaged"""
2017-10-05T17:06:10Z,discuss,"Unknown elements should be cloned during a ""copyFrom""
operation, otherwise reading code style settings from
disk, then cloning, results in the cloned instance
being different that the instance read from disk
(if some elements are unknown)."
2017-10-05T17:06:10Z,discuss,"This happens 100% of the time after running Android
Studio from intellij because Android Studio adds
elements that are unknown to the settings used
in PlatformTestCase."
