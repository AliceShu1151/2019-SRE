421,Replace coll.stream().forEachOrdered(..) with coll.forEach(..)
2016-06-26T16:00:06Z,discuss,This is a follow-up to IDEA-156324. Sometimes people use collection.stream().forEachOrdered(...) (GitHub search) which also could be replaced with collection.forEach(...). This PR enhances SimplifyStreamApiCallChainsInspection to support forEachOrdered.
