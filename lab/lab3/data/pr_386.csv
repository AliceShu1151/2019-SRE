Gevent support will not work in that case. For PyQt support we create an import hook, so it will work if only PyQt is imported after connecting to debugger (also there is a matplotlib import hook in console, they can overlap each other). Does PyQt support really work after your fix?
So the only reason to do that is to collect runtime information. But for collecting it you can just run debugger once in a casual way (via Run configuration) and don't care about it anymore."

2016-05-07T15:44:21Z,discuss,I do not understand why you think it is ok to ignore stepping filters or collecting run time type info when connecting from console. If you were the user what would you expect the behavior to be?
