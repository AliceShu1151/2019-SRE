2018-03-26T23:45:15Z,discuss,This is work in progress. It works but needs to be productionized. I gave you access to the branch in case you have time to work on this.
2018-03-27T11:01:28Z,discuss,Hi @fitermay! It looks very interesting. At the moment we're going to have a 2018.1 release and we're going to fix regressions and bugs in new features in minor updates. But after that we can discuss your implementation. Thank you!
2018-08-07T12:53:57Z,discuss,"Hi @fitermay! Sorry for the late response, but unfortunately I didn't have time to prepare it for release in PyCharm 2018.2. I'll do my best to merge it in PyCharm 2018.3."
