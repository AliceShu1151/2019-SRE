2015-06-08T10:50:42Z,discuss,"I really don't like this API, because it can break a lot of features in the product. There is a lot of code that opens a certain file in the editor and then starts modifying editor text, for example, to offer a live template of some kind. That code will randomly corrupt text if the navigation policy replaces the requested file with a different one behind the caller's back."
