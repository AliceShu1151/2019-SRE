2015-02-20T22:51:53Z,discuss,"This change will enable JVM variable overriding. Oracle's JVM uses the last variable, which means that if we have the same variable defined twice, only the second value will be used, e.g. if -Xmx is defined twice, once in user's _VM_OPTIONS file and once in idea.vmoptions in bin/idea.vmoptions, user's -Xmx will be used by JVM."
