624,"Update settings-repository plugin's ""more info"" link"
2017-09-05T04:55:22Z,discuss,"The formerly independent settings-repository plugin is now bundled with IDEA, but the ""more info"" link in its plugin description still points to what is now a stale, archived GitHub repository. This change updates the link to the current location."
2017-09-05T04:55:22Z,discuss,"Note that since it is no longer a GitHub project page being linked to, but instead a plugin included within a much larger project, I've decided to link directly to the README.md file, rather than, say, linking to a directory deep within the IDEA source tree that happens to contain the correct README.
(Either choice would be satisfactory at the moment, given the currently sparse directory contents and the current way in which GitHub renders directories that containing README files.)"
