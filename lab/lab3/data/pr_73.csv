2013-05-22T08:26:26Z,discuss,Thanks for the pull request.
2013-05-22T08:26:26Z,discuss,"I think org.jetbrains.idea.svn.SvnUtil#isWorkingCopyRoot can be used to determine if the file is a subversion root, without introducing a new method for this. The rest of the change looks fine."
2013-05-22T18:02:52Z,discuss,"Yes, it would also work.
I just tried performance, and my solution is slower on the start, but then faster on every refresh of the changelist."
2013-05-22T18:02:52Z,discuss,"3 existing items in ignore, the third one is wc root. Start of the IntelliJ and few refreshes :"

2013-05-22T18:02:52Z,discuss,So do you still want to use SvnUtil#isWorkingCopyRoot?
2013-05-27T09:17:05Z,discuss,"Your solution is obviously faster (the difference is not very significant though), because it just compares with a map of RootsToWorkinCopies, while SvnUtil.isWorkingCopyRoot checks the File itself.
I think your solution can be used then."
