16,Hg4idea create branch
2012-08-30T15:10:15Z,discuss,This pull request adds a missing feature to the Mercurial plugin : Manage branches. It simply allows to create branches on multilple repositories in the same time and allows to close the current branch.
2012-08-30T15:10:15Z,discuss,I did not really respect the plugin architecture since it seems to be limited to one repository by command. I may have not did it right but I'm sure many developers needs these features.
