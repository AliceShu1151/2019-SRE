2015-02-03T07:59:37Z,discuss,"Hi Jorge!
This is really cool. I'll accept the pull request after some improvements."
2015-02-03T11:52:22Z,discuss,Don't worry about tests. Not a big deal actually. I'll write one or two examples to guarantee the feature won't be broken in future.
2015-02-09T13:15:17Z,discuss,Sorry for the delay. We will accept your commit in a few day. Thanks!
2015-02-09T14:44:03Z,discuss,"That's really nice to know! I have a question, though: if I wanted this to be included on the next version of Android Studio should I add another PR to the 135 branch? Thank you "
2015-02-09T15:59:28Z,discuss,If you want we can try to cherry-pick this to 135. But are you sure Android Studio uses the 135 branch?
2015-02-09T16:14:00Z,discuss,"It is, as far as I know. The about me dialog shows 135 as build number and this answer in SO seems to support that."
2015-03-10T08:36:33Z,discuss,"Hi, is there any way I can help to make this PR merge? It's been almost a month since the last update."
2016-03-23T13:25:14Z,discuss,"Merged manually with updates.
@Arasthel actually it was like year ago, sorry for no notification."
