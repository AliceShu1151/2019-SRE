2018-07-12T15:10:14Z,discuss,Thank you for the contribution!
2018-07-12T15:10:14Z,discuss,"There is a little issue with the PR, unfortunately."
2018-07-12T15:10:14Z,discuss,"As a result, hg4idea and git4idea include a lot of almost duplicated code. The better approach would be to move common code from both plugins to the dvcs-impl module. Could you please adjust the changes accordingly?"
2018-07-12T15:37:33Z,discuss,"@dmitriysmirnovjb You're right, I chose to do it this way so I can easily patch existing IDEA installations before the PR is approved.
This can obviously be done a lot better."
2018-07-20T03:39:36Z,discuss,"@dmitriysmirnovjb @AMPivovarov  I moved most of the UI code into dvcs-impl, had to play a little catch-up with GitCompareBranchesDiffPanel changes.
Hopefully this can be reviewed soon, otherwise it'll need constant re-merging."
2018-07-20T18:04:21Z,discuss,Thanks for your contribution!
2018-07-20T18:04:21Z,discuss,"Sorry for your troubles with conflicts.
I've noticed that it caused merge conflicts (and broke API for some plugins, that you couldn't know), so I thought to resolve them and apply manually."
2018-07-20T22:34:38Z,discuss,"@AMPivovarov Thank you for looking into it. I assume it broke things outside the intellij-community repo, but why would merge conflicts not be visible on github?"
2018-07-21T09:55:34Z,discuss,"@idlsoft Yes, those were third-party plugins from Plugin Repository."
2018-07-21T09:55:34Z,discuss,Merged pull request to 2018.3 branch.
