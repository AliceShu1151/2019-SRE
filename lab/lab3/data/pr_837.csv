837,Uniformize all color scheme hexadecimal colors
2018-07-25T00:50:43Z,discuss,"With the colorSchemes folder left untouched for the past 6 months and my obsession with consistency, I could no longer deal with the mix of uppercase and lowercase hexadecimal color values."
2018-07-25T00:50:43Z,discuss,"Thus, I've replaced all lowercase hexadecimal colors to uppercase."
2018-07-25T00:50:43Z,discuss,"Since the color schemes are very unlikely to be modified anyways, I figured it might as well be properly formatted."

2018-07-25T12:16:14Z,discuss,@dyadix I'd suppose that we need to update https://github.com/JetBrains/colorSchemeTool/blob/master/colorSchemeTool.py#L42 accordingly
2018-07-25T13:58:12Z,discuss,"@denofevil I already signed the contributor agreement, and good point. I'll do that when I get home."
2018-07-28T17:09:33Z,discuss,"@denofevil I agree, we should update the conversion tool instead and load the updated schemes."
2018-07-28T17:55:54Z,discuss,"@dyadix See JetBrains/colorSchemeTool#22, it does just that."
2018-07-30T11:08:15Z,discuss,"Merged as 8c12470, thank you!"
