203,Install CustomShortcuts for Editor Up and Down in every trees widgets
2014-07-26T17:33:38Z,discuss,After remaping up/down keys it allows me to use new shortcuts in every ListScrollingUtil based list widgets but not in any tree widgets.
2014-07-26T17:33:38Z,discuss,For tree widgets there is coresponding TreeUtil class with installActions but without handling custom shortcuts.
