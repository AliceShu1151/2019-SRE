2019-11-22T14:02:06Z,discuss,"Each call to Method.getParameterTypes() clones underlying array, and in many cases the copy is used only to get it's length i.e. number of method params. So I propose to use Method.getParameterCount() which returns number of method's arguments without cloning of underlying array."
