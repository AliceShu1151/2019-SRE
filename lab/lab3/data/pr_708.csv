2018-01-13T16:30:31Z,discuss,This class is deprecated and is not intended to be used. It was not removed only to keep compatibility with plugins which have not yet been updated.
2018-01-13T16:37:03Z,discuss,"To keep compatibility, it must work properly.
The method, however, has a bug that cannot copy streams of which size less than the size of a buffer.
So, not updated plugins won't work properly, and I'm using one of them."
2018-01-13T16:44:00Z,discuss,"Nope, ""keeping compatibility"" means ""not breaking the stuff that used to work""."
2018-01-13T16:44:00Z,discuss,"Maybe you could send a pull request to the plugin, to help the author in migrating to new API?"
2018-01-13T16:58:08Z,discuss,"The bug will ""break the stuff that used to work"".
This class was just ""added"" at 2017.3 with removing org.apache.sanselan package.
(change notes, commit log)
I cannot find the original source of your customized org.apache.sanselan package, but it doesn't have the same bug. (Please refer this source)
Please refer the original source from here."
