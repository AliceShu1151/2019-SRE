2018-10-15T13:12:57Z,discuss,"@ekudel Now it's possible to add any action to ""InspectionToolWindow.ExportPopup"". I don't think it should be a kind of public API. I believe export html/xml actions should be unified and single abstract class should be extracted to export results to arbitrary given format"
2018-10-15T14:53:14Z,discuss,"@batya239 Well, now the only common part of ExportToHTMLAction and ExportToXMLAction is showing ""Export"" dialog. All other code is completely different: visiting, etc (perhaps it can be changed, but it looks like a quite big task, so I'm just suggesting a small refactoring now). However this dialog is actually HTML-specific (for example it contains ""open in browser"" checkbox), and for our custom action we don't need it, so I hardly understand what that abstract class (user for all ""export"" actions) should contain. By the way we want to provide a custom action for exporting to Hybris-compatible XLSX format. However there could be other ways to export inspection results to XLSX provided by the platform or another plugin, so one-to-one relationship between formats and handlers wouldn't seem to work here."
