1140,native fsNotifier: try to use a rule-based filename as alternative for ex. aarch64
2019-05-19T06:54:09Z,discuss,"These patches add a platform-specific fsnotifier for linux-aarch64. It also extends NativeFileWatcherImpl.getExecutable() to generate a platform-specific filename to look for if the hardcoded choices are not met.
Follow-up on #1126 , please see for more details on the whereabouts.
Tried and tested on a Jetson nano, with IDEA and PyCharm 191.7479."
2019-04-28T19:52:13Z,discuss,"Hi there,"
2019-04-28T19:52:13Z,discuss,"just got around testing this a little more. The code does the things I want it to do (with Java being a strange language and all that), only integrating the make of fsnotifier-linux-aarch64 executable into the build is still missing. I couldn't convince my build system to actually generate a package of PyCharm-CE to test on my Jetson Nano system, but IntelliJ-IDEA is running fine now with the native fsnotifier, after also installing /etc/sysctl.d/60-jetbrains.conf`. My hope is to get this merged and to get a new release sometime that is hackable or just works . :)"

2019-06-06T23:11:25Z,discuss,FYI https://www.linuxondex.com is another use case where this would help.
2019-10-18T20:25:05Z,discuss,Sorry for the late reply.
2019-10-18T20:25:05Z,discuss,"At the moment, JB does not want to support other architectures besides x86/x86-64. Starting from the next 2019.3 build, IDEs will provide a user with instructions on building and installing the fsnotifier binary on their system."
2019-10-18T20:29:58Z,discuss,"If this means that the local-arch fsnotifier will be loaded, good. Otherwise, how does this work?"
2019-10-18T20:33:23Z,discuss,"With some help from a user, yes. Here are the instructions: https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IDEADEV/Compiling+File+Watcher."
2019-10-18T20:36:31Z,discuss,"Great, thanks!"
2019-11-28T13:15:13Z,discuss,Note that IJ 2019.3 with native fsnotifier compiled still logs exception in other part:
2019-11-28T13:50:34Z,discuss,^ Just a warning; one can get rid of it by adding idea.io.use.nio2 = true to Help | Edit Custom Properties.
2019-11-30T18:19:23Z,discuss,"That's great, should be added to https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IDEADEV/Compiling+File+Watcher. No idea if it increases the speed, when I understood the code correctly nio2 is already the fallback when no libc fstat is available."
2019-12-02T13:20:39Z,discuss,"No, it shouldn't - first, it is not related in any way to fsnotifier; second, we're going to use NIO2 by default (probably in the next version)."
