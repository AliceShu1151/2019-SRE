1200,Fix path bug ('/' instead of ':' on osx for example)
2019-09-17T16:48:19Z,discuss,"Simple bug, but critical.  IJ shouldn't be looking on the path to find binaries
that are relative, such as ./myBinary.  pathSeparatorChar actually is the
character used to separate elements in the PATH environment variable, not
the character used to separate directories in the filesystem."

2019-09-23T12:44:53Z,discuss,"@klikh @trespasserw Any thoughts on merging this?  It's pretty simple fix, but damn is the underlying bug super annoying and frankly pretty dangerous (can lead to execution of unexpected programs by IJ pretty easily)."
