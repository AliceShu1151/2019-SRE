553,SystemHealthMonitor: fix notification race
2017-04-14T16:27:28Z,discuss,"Android Studio defines a custom first-run wizard, which exposes
a race condition in displaying notifications in SystemHealthMonitor."
2017-04-14T16:27:28Z,discuss,"The root problem is that the appFrameCreated callback happens before
the frame is actually visible, see IdeaApplication where we have:"
2017-04-14T16:27:28Z,discuss,"lifecyclePublisher.appFrameCreated(args, willOpenProject)
... followed by, later
WelcomeFrame.showNow()"
2017-04-14T16:27:28Z,discuss,"And WelcomeFrame.showNow() first goes through extensions before making
itself available:"
2017-04-14T16:27:28Z,discuss,"if (ourInstance == null) {
...
for (WelcomeFrameProvider provider : EP.getExtensions()) {
frame = provider.createFrame();
}
...
ourInstance = frame;
}"
2017-04-14T16:27:28Z,discuss,"For any non-trivial extension that displays a dialog and starts
consuming events from the AWT queue, this leads to a race condition:
if SystemHealthMonitor has notifications to show, it may not see
any visible frame and throw an NPE because the welcome frame didn't
get a chance to initialize itself."
2017-04-14T16:27:28Z,discuss,"We propose to use the appStarting callback, which is guaranteed to
happen later in a separate transaction."
