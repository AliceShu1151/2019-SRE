2019-12-13T03:01:35Z,discuss,"One of our UI tests creates an Android Instrumented Tests configuration by opening the Run/Debug Configurations dialog, clicking the +, and selecting Android Instrumented Tests in the popup. But the Swing in IDEA never gets the simulated mouse click, the instrumented test configuration is not created, and the test fails."

I just checked that removing isClick entirely (its calculation and from the condition) works well for the issue I was originally fixing: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-217535
Please do so and check it your tests pass. If they do I'll remove isClick."
