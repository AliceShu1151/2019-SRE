1029,Fix a bug in JBLoadingPanel in setBounds method.
2019-01-11T01:52:20Z,discuss,"When JBLoadingPanel#setBounds is called it only updates its boundaries and its underlying LoadingDecorator panel doesn't get updated resulting an unexpected layouts.
This patch fixes it by overriding setBounds method and propagating the update to LoadingDecorator properly."

2019-04-26T21:10:56Z,discuss,"I commented in https://youtrack.jetbrains.net/issue/IDEA-205343:
Cannot see the problem, setBounds() in JBLoadingPanel causes revalidation and finally calls LoadingDecorator.MyLayeredPane#doLayout
Can you give an example of noticeable ""unexpected layout""?"
