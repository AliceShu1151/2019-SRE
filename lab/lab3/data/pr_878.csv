878,Detect extra syspath correctly
2018-09-30T16:23:47Z,discuss,Code completion for GTK and other PyGObject based libraries is broken because the stub generation does not work. The reason for this is that the gi-repository directory which contains the typelibs is not detected by PyCharm due to a bug in the extra_syspath.py helper script. This script fails because it assumes that module.__path__ is a string while it actually is a list. This causes the call of p.split() to fail and the script to terminate seemingly successfully (as AttributeErrors are caught and ignored) but without returning an extra syspath directory.
2018-09-30T16:23:47Z,discuss,This commit fixes this problem by extracting the first element of the module.__path__ list. After applying this fix stub generation finds the typelibs in the gi-repository and code completion for GTK is working again.
