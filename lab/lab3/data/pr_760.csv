760,Fix ThreeComponentsSplitter focus cycle
2018-03-14T20:14:22Z,discuss,"Allow tab to navigate focus between the 3 panels of
ThreeComponentsSplitter by changing the traversal policy and removing
ThreeComponentsSplitter as the focus cycle root. This allows for users
of the component the control of the focus cycle instead."

2018-05-07T11:29:49Z,discuss,"@PureSin The idea of the traversal policy is to find the best child in a split component. As far as I remember LayoutFocusTraversalPolicy does not always satisfy this approach. The problem is in the split component structure. Usually, they are composite components and layout does not suggest the best component to focus."
