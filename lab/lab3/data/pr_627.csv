627,Do not force reindex on content files with compatible language levels
2017-09-12T01:07:57Z,discuss,"We switch between 2.6 and 2.7 frequently. Currently this forces a reindex of the
entire project (100k+ files). I believe this reindexing is not necessary for Python
Language levels which are AST compatible."
