Have you seen ProjectDataImportListener#onImportFinished api?
Could you check if it's applicable for you?"
2018-06-04T21:08:56Z,discuss,"Hi @vladsoroka
no, I haven't noticed that api. Although it doesn't give me the new module, it seems to be enough to resolve my problem. Thank you very much."

It should be enough to get all imported data and/or customize it."
2018-06-05T09:56:41Z,discuss,If you need module information you can extends AbstractProjectDataService with the ProjectKeys.MODULE and use IdeModifiableModelsProvider#findIdeModule(ModuleData module) method:
