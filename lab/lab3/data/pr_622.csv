Thanks for the submission."
2017-09-04T10:12:22Z,discuss,"How do you think, wouldn't it be better to replace these checkboxes with notification actions?

2017-09-04T16:15:11Z,discuss,"Ah, I knew there was a clipboard manager, just couldn't find it, thanks!"
2017-09-04T16:15:11Z,discuss,"As for the notification actions suggestion, I do agree that it works a lot cleaner than adding an additional check box to the Gist creation dialog box, but I do personally like having it persistently remember the action. Seeing that the Open in browser action has both a check box and notification action would it be ok to do the same with the copy to clipboard action and have both a check box and notification action?"
2017-09-12T08:36:10Z,discuss,"Hi!
If you want this option to be persistently remembered maybe it is better to move the setting to VCS -> GitHub settings page?"
2017-09-17T13:23:40Z,discuss,"It's kind of something I want to be like the open in browser action. If I selected it last time I want it to remember, and if I didn't last time I don't want it to the next time. It's not something I really want hidden in a settings page, I'd rather have it out front when I'm about to upload."
