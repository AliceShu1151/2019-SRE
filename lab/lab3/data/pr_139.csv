139,Enable per-file trim-trailing-whitespace and ensure-final-newline settings
2013-12-16T07:54:07Z,discuss,"This change will allow per-file overriding of settings handled by the TrailingSpacesStripper class. The specific motivation for this is to support the editorconfig-jetbrains plugin. For an example of how this extension to TrailingSpacesStripper can be used, see the EditorSettingsManager class in the ""future"" branch of the editorconfig plugin."
2013-12-16T07:54:07Z,discuss,"I'm not sure if the TrailingSpacesStripper class is the best place to keep the new UserData keys and string constants that I introduced, so please feel free to change where those live and I will update accordingly."
2013-12-16T07:54:07Z,discuss,"Also, I have done some basic testing to make sure that this patch works well with my plugin, but I am having some issues running the IntelliJ test suite. I have been in contact with one of your developers about this patch, so I will work with her to make sure that the patch doesn't introduce any regressions and that my new tests work okay. I just wanted to go ahead and get the pull request out."
