2014-12-14T16:57:19Z,discuss,"I can't figure out how to commit through CommitChangeListDialog without actual changes, so without changes I show my window for commit message and then perform commit. If there are changes, I invoke CommonCheckinProjectAction"
2014-12-22T17:12:43Z,discuss,I've implemented this feature in a little different way. Now you have an ability to  call the commit dialog and perform commit&close branch action from status bar ->  branches widget. Please see appropriate commit ae92a76. Thank you for your contribution.
2014-12-23T12:00:25Z,discuss,"@NadyaZabrodina, in this way there are no possibility to close branch and ""commit and push"", that's why  i make ""close branch"" kind of commit property and not the action. Anyway, your implementation is fine for me as i not really often use ""commit and push"". Thanks!"
