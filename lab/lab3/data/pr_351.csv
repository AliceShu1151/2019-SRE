351,[Fernflower] Make the default renamer rename classes that have a name that is reserved by the windows namespace
2016-02-03T03:48:52Z,discuss,This commit makes fernflowers default renamer rename classes that have a name that is reserved by the windows namespace. See https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247(v=vs.85).aspx#naming_conventions for more information on names reserved by the windows namespace. There are currently obfuscators that take advantage of the fact that classes with these names cannot be extracted from a jar. An example of one such obfuscator is Allatori http://www.allatori.com/doc.html#property-classes-naming.
