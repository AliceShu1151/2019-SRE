* content: Creating multiple packages in the current IDEA version required specific efforts.

* content: To create packages, for example, com.example.project.sample and com.example.project.test, there are several options:

* content: As a correction of this situation, I suggest that when creating a package in the initialText of dialog, set the name of the package on which the action of creating a new package was performed. For example:

* content: To implement this functionality, I had to split the validator of the entered text in the old code of the CreateDirectoryOrPackageAction action, which was previously used simultaneously to create a directory and to create a package. Saving the CreateDirectoryOrPackageAction class allowed maintaining compatibility with all dependent code, and CreateDirectoryOrPackageHandler is still used to create the directory. Actions are delegated to it by CreateDirectoryHandler.

* content: I think itâ€™s worth thinking about split actions handler itself into two kinds, but this can disrupt the work of a lot of old code. And it may also be worth adding drop-down hints when entering the names of existing packages.
