2018-05-03T16:56:05Z,discuss,Thanks! Merged 210f54d
2018-05-03T20:06:13Z,discuss,I can't reproduce the problem in question in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.
2018-05-03T20:06:13Z,discuss,"The case is already handled via UIUtil.NOT_IN_HIERARCHY_COMPONENTS key.
See ProjectViewImpl.MyPanel#init (ProjectViewImpl:996)"
2018-05-03T20:06:13Z,discuss,If for some reason that does not work we shall investigate why so.
2018-05-03T20:06:13Z,discuss,This pull request shall be reconsidered.
2018-05-03T20:16:42Z,discuss,"@gregsh Do you prefer to revert commit 210f54d then?
@jgaillard85 What's your understanding of the situation?"
2018-05-03T21:15:10Z,discuss,"@gregsh Thanks! I started Android Studio from sources from master and can't reproduce the problem with or without the fix. So, we probably need to revert it."
2018-05-03T21:15:10Z,discuss,"P.S.
The only thing I noticed is wrong foreground for Design Editor
