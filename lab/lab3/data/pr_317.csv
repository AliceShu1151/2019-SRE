317,IDEA-147080 Groovy Pointless Boolean Inspection should remove double negation
2015-10-30T07:19:33Z,discuss,"Groovy Pointless Boolean Inspection should simplify by removing
the double negation when it is the case."
2016-03-01T09:31:47Z,discuss,"you could use Boolean.parseBoolean(operand) here, and .toString it later"
2016-03-01T09:31:58Z,discuss,can be single line also
2016-03-01T09:32:31Z,discuss,"this seems dangerous (will replace a single negation also), and is repeated in the code"
2016-03-01T09:33:58Z,discuss,"Please provide some examples in the description of the commit, it's not obvious to me what happened before, and what happens now."
2016-03-01T09:33:58Z,discuss,"Also, more tests might help as well :)"
2016-03-01T09:34:37Z,discuss,same as below...
2016-03-01T09:35:07Z,discuss,5 is a microoptimization
2016-03-01T09:35:35Z,discuss,! is not a sign (you call it prefix below)
2018-07-25T16:57:10Z,discuss,"@vladmm, please rebase the PR"
2019-06-23T00:37:27Z,discuss,"hey @vladmm
could you resolve the conflicts?"
