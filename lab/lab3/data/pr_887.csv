887,merge duplicated ArrayUtil.indexOf into single method
2018-10-13T14:24:08Z,discuss,There are some duplicates related to indexOf/lastIndexOf methods. I've merged them.
2018-10-15T07:41:50Z,discuss,"Please leave an explicit indexOf delegate in ArrayUtil class: this is part of a public API, so it would be good to keep it there. Relying on ArrayUtil extends ArrayUtilRt looks fragile to me."
2018-10-16T08:11:16Z,discuss,"Sure, I'll revert it.  Btw, is it reasonable to use Arrays::asList for indexOf/find? This will bring additional allocation, but from another point of view reduce amount of compiled code."
2018-10-16T10:38:19Z,discuss,"I think, for such low-level methods specialized implementation is better than delecation to Arrays.asList"
