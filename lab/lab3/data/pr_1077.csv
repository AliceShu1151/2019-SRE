1077,Add missing break statement (see IDEA-208467)
2019-03-06T10:47:50Z,discuss,"This raise-a-flag pattern is very wide-spread and often implemented without break statement after flag is raised.
In case if-statement doesn't have any side-effects all iterations executed after the flag is raised are useless, as flag's value won't change.
The statement or iteration however are often time-consuming which impacts performance."
