1049,Make Gradle's ProjectImportAction more flexible
2019-01-29T16:30:54Z,discuss,"This change gives more flexibility providers of GradleProjectResolverExtensions to inject logic when requesting models from Gradle during the ProjectImportAction. We allow extensions to provide a ProjectImportExtraModelProvider instead of a set list of classes, this provider has two methods which are both run within the build action. Each method provides a consumer-like interface for the provider to register the models that they are interested in so they are visible to the resolver context during setup."

2019-01-29T16:30:54Z,discuss,I've ran any tests that I could that look like they might be affected. E.g in intellij.gradle.tests the results are consistent with or without the change (though both end up with ~100 failures). Any instruction on how best to test the new functionality would be appreciated.
2019-01-29T16:30:54Z,discuss,Thanks!
2019-02-01T11:26:01Z,discuss,so far looks good to me. I will run this patch through our TeamCity (CI server)
2019-02-01T14:06:21Z,discuss,"Cool, thanks!"
2019-02-01T14:15:49Z,discuss,Our integration tests went fine. Will merge the request manually
