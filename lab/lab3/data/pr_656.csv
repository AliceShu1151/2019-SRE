656,Improve the doc-comment on PsiNameIdentifierOwner
2017-10-31T13:01:16Z,discuss,"While implementing reference resolve and rename in a custom language
plugin, I ran into a subtle bug caused by failing to override

the code into TargetElementUtil and finding a useful comment about
the importance of overriding the text offset on named elements."
