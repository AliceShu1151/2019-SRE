2016-03-12T14:17:53Z,discuss,This fixes the icon for the jetbrains IDEs appearing twice due to random memory being added to the WM_CLASS because it missed the null-terminator. This happened for example in the gnome launcher.

2016-03-12T14:40:07Z,discuss,"@klikh Are you sure it's necessary to sign a 1-2 page legal paper to contribute a 2 line change?
I will gladly state that I waive all my rights to these 2 lines here on github. I am not knowledgeable enough to understand all the legal speech used in the agreement you linked, really."
2016-03-16T14:28:18Z,discuss,"WM_CLASS is assembled from an array, and the value of awtAppClassName field isn't always the second part of the pair. So, thank you for pointing to a problem, but I cannot accept the fix as-is, sorry. I'll submit a patch for inclusion in our build of JDK, and hopefully upstream to Oracle."
2016-03-16T14:37:19Z,discuss,"In fact, the bug is already fixed by Oracle, scheduled for 8u82 (see JDK-6961123 for details)."

2016-03-19T15:50:25Z,discuss,"As 8u82 will only be released in July 2016 (see https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/projects/JDK/versions/18319), it would be good to fix this now."
2016-03-19T15:50:25Z,discuss,I've been using the patch I submitted here in production without any issues - can you give clearer references to the issues you are expecting to happen here?
2016-03-19T17:36:04Z,discuss,"Right, that's why we'll port the fix to our custom JDK ASAP."
2016-03-19T17:36:04Z,discuss,"The problem is, at early stages, WM_CLASS would be in a ""name\0\0name\0"" format. I'm not sure this won't break any other WMs."
