890,GuiDesigner update
2018-10-14T22:31:06Z,discuss,"This is a GuiDesigner update. Now it's possible to select a Look and Feel from a list in Form properties and see how
it changes the design of the desired form. Some component properties are initialized based on selected
look and feel. I have also started to implement a way to load custom look and feel, but I can't make it works...
So I hope someone can do it in next updates."
