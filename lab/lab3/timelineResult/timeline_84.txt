* type: discussion
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* time: 2013-06-28T09:26:41Z
* content: (I'm very, very, sorry... for the life of me, I cannot figure out how to get github to create a pull request that has only the 2nd commit, as I previously submitted the first commit in a different pull request.)
* time: 2013-06-28T11:06:25Z
* content: Each of your commits should have been in a separate branch. Then GitHub will handle them as two independent pull requests.
* time: 2013-06-28T13:56:00Z
* content: I'm apparently no good with git. Despite using IntelliJ to create a new branch, and commit the second changeset to that branch, somehow the first commit also wound up on that 2nd branch.
