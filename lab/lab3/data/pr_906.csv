906,Suspend indexing while refreshing project structure
2018-10-30T20:57:14Z,discuss,In my testing it actually improved the initial importing time from roughly 14 minutes to just 3 and a half minutes.
2018-10-30T20:57:14Z,discuss,Also included pausing indexing while choosing projects to import. It's very handy with external.system.show.selective.import.dialog  to avoid unnecessary indexing.
