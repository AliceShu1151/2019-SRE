719,py/resolve: consider all candidate module paths
2018-01-31T01:23:05Z,discuss,"Since c4f1959, ResolveImportUtil::resolveNameInFromImport only ever considers the first candidate returned by PyFromImportStatement::resolveImportSourceCandidates. This makes it iterate over all candidates."
2018-01-31T18:37:23Z,discuss,@rohanjoyce Thanks for your pull request! Could you please add unit tests that show what the problem was and how the fix has helped with it?
2018-01-31T18:37:23Z,discuss,"You can find test cases for resolving imported references in PyMultiFileResolveTest. Alternatively, there is PyUnresolvedReferencesInspectionTest that contains tests for the unresolved references inspection."
2018-01-31T21:41:09Z,discuss,"@vlasovskikh I've updated with four tests. Prior to this PR, testMultipleModulePathProviderCandidatesSamePackageDifferentModule and testMultipleModulePathProviderCandidatesReturnMultiple would fail. I thought it was worth including the other two tests for the 0 and 1 candidate cases."
2018-02-08T15:21:01Z,discuss,@rohanjoyce Thanks for your pull request! I've rebased it onto master. See also https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-28406.
