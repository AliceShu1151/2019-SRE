196,IDEA-87163: Make the remove-all-splits action always work
2014-06-26T20:40:12Z,discuss,"Currently, the UnsplitAll action is arbitrarily disabled when there are only two windows, which means that people who have this bound to a key find that it doesn't work in all the cases where a split is present. This patch removes that restriction."
2014-06-26T20:40:12Z,discuss,I have submitted a contributor agreement and was notified today that it has been accepted.
2014-07-23T20:42:20Z,discuss,Why does it take so long to have a pull request reviewed?
2014-07-25T16:32:08Z,discuss,"The issue was picked up by responsible developer (Sergey Malenkov), you may reach him via YouTrack."
