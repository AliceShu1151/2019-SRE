238,check myAssertThreading before using assertIsDispatchThread
2015-01-29T04:58:42Z,discuss,"The DocumentImpl constructor takes an argument called forUseInNonAWTThread, which is stored in the myAssertThreading field. While this field is checked before some assertions, it is not checked before others."
2015-01-29T04:58:42Z,discuss,"This change checks the field before all assertIsDispatchThread calls, enabling users to use more features of DocumentImpl outside the dispatch thread (as indicated by the constructor parameter)."
2015-01-29T04:58:42Z,discuss,"(It is unclear to me why the assertIsDispatchThread assertions are there at all -- the functions don't seem to require it at all. This is the least intrusive change, remove the assertions completely should maybe be considered.)"
