* content: This pull request makes the properties of ShRunConfiguration public to allow 3rd-party plugins to use the run configuration. This would allow 3rd-party plugins to add debug support, for example. Properties of ShRunConfiguration should be accessible to allow reuse.
* time: 2019-09-14T17:37:15Z
* content: It's not strictly needed to have public setter-methods. But public getter-methods and package-level setter-methods seems a bit awkward. I'm happy to change this if you want me to, though.
* time: 2019-10-05T09:18:29Z
* content: Is it the only way how you may add debug support? I'll be happy to review the way how you're planning to use information from these fields.

* content: @ignatov Thank you for you reply. The higher level reason is that to launch a Bash debugger (i.e. bashdb) it's required to execute bash --debugger <script.sh> [args configured by user, etc.]. This may also need an updated environment, etc. There are several ways to launch a bashdb debugger, bash --debugger is just one possibility.

* content: To implement this, access to the properties of ShRunConfiguration is needed because a new process needs to be setup and launched. If you know of any other way, I'd be happy to hear about it. (read-access to properties will also allow and simplify other 3rd-party plugins using Sh)
