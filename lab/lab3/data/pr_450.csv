450,Ensuring project directory is given priority prior to settings import
2016-09-26T14:28:20Z,discuss,"I'm developing a reusable Django app which has settings in example_project.settings. The example_project provides a project which is both a bare-bones example, and a bootstrap for the tests."
2016-09-26T14:28:20Z,discuss,"However ¨C and perhaps unsurprisingly ¨C another Django app also contained an example_project. Moreover, my project directories entry on sys.path only appears towards the end of the list, after many dependencies. In my case, the result was that the incorrect settings file would be imported."
