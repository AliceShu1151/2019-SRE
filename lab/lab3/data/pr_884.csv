884,[Fernflower] Cleanup of collections-related classes
2018-10-10T05:09:27Z,discuss,"I'm not 100% sure how useful this actually is, but this PR cleans up some of the different collections classes Fernflower has.  Originally prompted by me seeing VBStyleCollection and running away in fear."
2018-10-10T05:09:27Z,discuss,"This does include some various renames.  I don't think that the new names are perfect, though.  I've changed VBStyleCollection to KeyedList and FastSparseSet/FastFixedSet to UniversedSet.  I didn't rename SFormsFastMapDirect since I don't fully understand the more general context of its use."
2018-10-10T05:09:27Z,discuss,The code should behave exactly the same both before and after this change; all tests remain the same as before.
