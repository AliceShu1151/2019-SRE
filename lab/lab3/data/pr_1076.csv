1076,IDEA-208453: Fix a memory leak in GitXmlRpcHandlerService
2019-03-06T02:59:36Z,discuss,"GitXmlRpcHandlerService.registerHandler was registering anonymous Disposable objects with the Disposer. Since the parentDisposable passed to the registerHandler method is always a Project, these anonymous Disposables accumulated in the Disposer's tree for the life time of the project creating an memory leak."
2019-03-06T02:59:36Z,discuss,"This change replaces anonymous Disposables with instances of the HandlerWrapper class that are disposed either by the unregisterHandler method or together with the project, whichever comes first."
2019-03-06T10:16:07Z,discuss,"The disposable is no longer created after 509fead.
This, probably, makes this fix obsolete?"
2019-03-06T18:57:10Z,discuss,Obsolete indeed. Sorry for the noise.
2019-03-07T12:32:36Z,discuss,Thanks for the report anyway!
