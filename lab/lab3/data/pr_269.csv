269,Allowing users to specify environment variables in their embedded terminal sessions
2015-05-23T23:09:50Z,discuss,"I've added the environment variables dialog to the Embedded Terminal Settings. Any macro variables in the values are expanded. This provides a hook for passing in things like the PROJECT_DIR (IDEA-126640), IDEA_HOME (IDEA-134992), and anything else the user might want. I settled on PROJECT_DIR as the default because I wanted it myself, it seemed like a good example to show what users could do with the dialog, and it seemed it would provide a good base for a lot of tricks users might dream up."
