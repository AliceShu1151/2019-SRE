1188,IDEA-219943 language counters corner case
2019-08-14T18:13:53Z,discuss,I have thought of a corner case for the language-specific PSI modification trackers.
2019-08-14T18:13:53Z,discuss,Say I get a tracker with
2019-08-14T18:13:53Z,discuss,Now suppose the project has just been opened and the myLanguageTrackers is empty. Then exampleTracker.getModificationCount() will be 0.
2019-08-14T18:13:53Z,discuss,"Now, if the user deletes a Java file, ""all"" language counters will be incremented. Since myLanguageTrackers is still empty, though, no counters will be incremented. And so exampleTracker.getModificationCount() will still be 0, even though a Java file changed."
2019-08-14T18:13:53Z,discuss,"I guess the root cause is that forLanguages(Condition) allows a modification tracker to depend on languages that aren't in the myLanguageTrackers map yet. One possible fix is to have a separate ""unattributedLanguage"" modification tracker whose modification count is included with the modification trackers returned from forLanguage() and forLanguages()."
