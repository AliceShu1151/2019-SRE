631,fix TODO in ChangesListView.java
2017-09-24T18:39:04Z,discuss,I found TODO in ChangesListView and fixed it. At runtime changelist view seems to be working as before changes were introduced.

2017-10-05T09:40:06Z,discuss,"This cleanup introduces an issue with WideSelectionTreeUI.

2017-10-05T09:40:06Z,discuss,"Probably, this should be fixed in DnDAwareTree, but doing so would require checking for regressions all around IDE and under different OS and LaF.
So this pull request is reverted for now."
