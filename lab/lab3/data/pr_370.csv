370,[Fernflower] ClassReference14Processor cleanup
2016-03-14T06:15:45Z,discuss,"ClassReference14Processor has been made static similar to how EnumProcessor and InitializerProcessor are setup. This prevents a lot of redundant InvocationExprent creation. I also fixed a couple typos that I noticed while working on the codebase and split BasicBlockStatement.toJava(int indent, BytecodeMappingTracer tracer) into two lines to make it easier to interpret stack traces involving it."
