30,make the tools/lexer/jflex-1.4/bin/jflex script executable
2012-12-16T20:50:19Z,discuss,I started experimenting with writing a language plugin and immediatelly found out that the tools/lexer/jflex-1.4/bin/jflex script is not executable (on Linux). This pull request only consists of a result of running chmod +x jflex.
