1133,Removed const and goto in Java Flex lexer
2019-05-09T19:51:48Z,discuss,"In this PR I removed the const and goto keywords that were in the Java Flex implementation.
I know that this will not improve performance a lot but it is unnecessary and it also gets highlighted when you write it (not a big surprise)."

2019-05-13T16:53:12Z,discuss,"Even though const and goto are not used in Java, they are still keywords and can't be used as identifiers. See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.9
This also means that they should not be removed from the lexer."
