2018-08-14T14:22:25Z,discuss,"I have been using oh-my-fish along with fish shell for a long while, and have fish separately worked well in IDEA's embedded terminal. However now I got a boring message after I upgraded my All Product Pack to 2018.2"
2018-08-14T14:22:25Z,discuss,"IDEA now load all my functions from ~/fish/.config/fish/functions/. but one of them, fish_prompt.fish, is based on git_is_repo which is provided by oh-my-fish.
No matter where oh-my-fish itself locates, it is bootstrapped by ~/fish/.config/fish/conf.d/omf.fish, which should be loaded by IDEA."
2018-08-14T14:22:25Z,discuss,"From official document of fish, these files located in ~/fish/.config/fish/conf.d/ are called Configuration snippets and will be evaluated on startup of fish. Beside, it is noted that they are sourced before ~/.config/fish/config.fish"
