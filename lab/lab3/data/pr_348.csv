348,Sort when writing plugin list
2016-01-26T00:09:30Z,discuss,This sorts plugin lists when writing to disk.
2016-01-26T00:09:30Z,discuss,"I try to keep as much of my IntelliJ configuration in version control as possible. disabled_plugins.txt is an obnoxious file because it gets jumbled into a different order every time it's written to disk, resulting in a lot of unnecessary diffs. So it's nice to have it sorted just to keep the order consistent."

2016-05-26T16:11:14Z,discuss,"Thank you for the contribution. However 'iterator()' in PriorityQueue isn't guarantied to process elements in sorted order, so I've implemented this myself by copying collection into array and sorting it."
