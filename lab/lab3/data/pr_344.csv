Imagine that you have Java interface Foo with one method and implementing class FooImpl (in other file) that doesn't implement this method. Once you open FooImpl you get red wave in Project View for it.
Now open Foo and remove the method. Current behavior: red wave for FooImpl disappears. With your pull request it stays until you open FooImpl in editor again."

2016-01-11T15:52:36Z,discuss,"Right.  What if their was one solver per module instead of per project.  It would be a small amount of additional memory, but I think it would solve this issue since there is one language per module."
2016-01-11T15:52:36Z,discuss,"Unless you say otherwise, I'll take a look at this change, (and make sure to only format the edited parts of the file.)"
2016-01-11T15:57:45Z,discuss,"That's not true. Even in a simple Dart project you additionally have YAML language. And you may have as many as IDE supports, all in a single module."
