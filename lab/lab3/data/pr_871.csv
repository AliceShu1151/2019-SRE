871,"IJSDK-474 Clarify definition of ""IDEA jdk"" in README.md"
2018-09-24T19:07:29Z,discuss,This change attempts to clarify whether users should define the IDEA jdk based on JDK 1.6 or 1.8.
2018-09-24T19:07:29Z,discuss,"I found explaining this definition to be tricky because there are three audiences: plugin developers, internal engineers, and contributors to the IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition open source project.  I tried to reach the plugin developer audience first, and clarify which JDK should be used based on how a build will be used."

2018-09-27T07:42:26Z,discuss,Plugin developers don't need to setup and build intellij-community project. If they don't use gradle-intellij-plugin which downloads sources automatically they may check out intellij-community sources (see the docs but they don't need to setup that project or build it).
2018-09-30T21:17:16Z,discuss,"Thanks for your feedback. I was trying to clarify the wording because it apparently confused a developer. However, this might be a case of ""better"" being the enemy of good."
2018-09-30T21:17:16Z,discuss,How about I delete this pull request and backout the changes from my fork?
