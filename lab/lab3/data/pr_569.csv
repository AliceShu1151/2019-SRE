569,IDEA-145520 - Don't ask which changelist to make active if there is only one
2017-05-04T21:32:18Z,discuss,"The confirmation will not appear if only one changelist remains and all the deleted changelists are empty.
The remaining changelist will then be made active silently."
2017-05-04T21:32:18Z,discuss,If at least one deleted changelist is not empty the confirmation will be shown to give user a chance to cancel the deletion.
2017-05-04T21:32:18Z,discuss,"Also 'RemoveChangeList' action text is updated based on the selection size.
(""Delete Changelists"" looks a bit confusing when only one changelist is selected)"
