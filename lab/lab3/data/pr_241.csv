241,FileSystemUtil: Update JNA code to work on Linux/PPC
2015-02-10T21:28:16Z,discuss,"The struct stat64 offsets were incorrect for Linux/PPC32.
Add the correct offsets, and use them when OS_ARCH is ""ppc""."
2015-02-10T21:28:16Z,discuss,"Also, increase the ""ver"" parameter of __xstat64 to ""1"", since the
Linux/PPC64 libc rejects the value ""0""."
2015-02-10T21:28:16Z,discuss,"There might be more arches where the default offset table is incorrect,
but I can't test that right now."
2015-02-10T21:28:16Z,discuss,"I have tested this patch on Linux/PPC with IBM JDK 1.7.0 (both 32 and 64 bit)
and on Linux/x86 with Oracle JDK 1.7.0 (64 bit)."
