838,Move GradleInspectionBundle.properties into resource directory
2018-07-26T22:04:27Z,discuss,"This resource file was causing an error for Android Studio tests due to
the unconventional nature of the directory structure. The resource file
should be found underneath a directory tree that appears as
org/jetbrains/plugins/gradle/codeInspection."
2018-07-26T22:04:27Z,discuss,"Additionally, resource files should be kept separate from source files."
2018-07-26T23:10:11Z,discuss,"Actually, disregard this. I think if we're going to be moving a resource file outside of the source directory without the package prefix, every file in this module should sit in a directory structure without the package prefix. This change should be considered incomplete."
