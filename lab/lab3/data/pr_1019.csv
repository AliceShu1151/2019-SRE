1019,1st stage of fixing IDEA-204628
2018-12-22T01:51:18Z,discuss,"IntelliJ IDEA can be build by other IntelliJ IDEA but not yet by the 'ant' command.
I can't figure out how to add the lib/tools.jar of JDK into the compile time classpath.
Ant calls Gradle and in Gradle you can call 'org.gradle.internal.jvm.Jvm.current().toolsJar'
to get full path into the lib/tools.jar library, but I didn't find the right place to put it in.
Standard examples of using it, found in Google, don't work here."
2018-12-22T01:51:18Z,discuss,Hope someone will help me to figure out how to add lib/tools.jar of JDK into the compile time classpath and I will do it in the second commit in this PR.
