1152,IDEA-209506 Skip empty classpath roots fed to JUnit5TestRunner
2019-06-05T17:24:46Z,discuss,"Change JUnit5TestRunnerUtil to validate emptiness of the classpath roots returned from JUnit 5. Only propagate non-empty results to the test runner. Fixes an issue with recent versions of Android Studio, which don't support the execution of single-module test suites using JUnit 5 at the moment because of an overzealous iterator."
