1145,Skip/ignore disposed modules in the project view.
2019-05-26T17:07:35Z,discuss,"The project view is updated asynchronously via a MergeQueue and
invokeLater calls. Therefore its nodes may for short periods of time
refer to disposed modules. If it happens that such a node is accessed
before it is updated it typically results in a crash."
2019-05-26T17:07:35Z,discuss,"This change fixes several most common cases where this type of crash can
happen. The fix is similar to how disposed modules are already handled
in the same classes."
2019-05-26T17:07:35Z,discuss,"Bug: 133469297
Test: n/a (manually by increasing MergeQueue update time to 10 seconds)
