2019-09-24T05:34:35Z,discuss,This adds two unit tests that reproduces IDEA-223397.
2019-09-24T05:34:35Z,discuss,(Sorry I don't know my way around the editor enough to attempt an actual fix for the bug)
2019-09-27T16:20:20Z,discuss,Cannot push a test which fails (without a fix for the problem).
2019-09-27T22:16:42Z,discuss,"@JB-Dmitry Note that I didn't expect you to directly merge it with a failing test. This is a demonstration that the bug really exists and is reproducible, to serve as a starting point for someone knowledgeable to address the issue. Is there a way to annotate the test as being expected to fail until the issue is addressed? (equivalent to Python's http://docs.python.org/dev/library/unittest.html#unittest.expectedFailure)"
