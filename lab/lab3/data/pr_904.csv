2018-10-28T20:39:26Z,discuss,From Maven 3.6.0 and Maven Resolver 1.3.0 internal logging has been migrated to the SLF4J.
2018-11-30T10:21:37Z,discuss,Code modified but I don't know where I can find this message logged. In all code in this DefaultArtifactResolver class there is only one debug line and here we catch specific NoSuchMethodError exception.
2018-12-03T20:19:40Z,discuss,Take a look at my pull request with a better fix: #999
