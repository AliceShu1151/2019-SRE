2017-11-14T09:27:14Z,discuss,"I've checked the request, while it's okay as disabling inspection for non-resolvable, I think the problem is that such expression are unresolvable in the first place, and to make them resolvable we need bigger changes in the API.

I've committed a few more similar PRs, please check them too"
