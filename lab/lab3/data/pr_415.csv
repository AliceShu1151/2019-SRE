2018-07-21T16:32:22Z,discuss,"Sorry for the late reply, we somehow missed this pull request. It looks like we already set jna.nosys property inside the IDE (see 83eeacb) and while installing patches (see cbcfe98). Also IDEA run configuration is used to run IntelliJ IDEA from sources only, and it isn't possible to update it via patch in that mode."
