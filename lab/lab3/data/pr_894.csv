2018-10-21T22:05:45Z,discuss,"I've spent quite some time trying to figure out how to plug on the test integration of Intellij, and the lack of documentation definitely frustrated me in the process, so I figured I'd open a small PR to improve it."
2018-10-21T22:05:45Z,discuss,"It's my first PR on this repo, I read the guidelines, but please let me know if anything is missing."
2018-10-21T22:05:45Z,discuss,Cheers
2018-10-22T09:44:41Z,discuss,Thanks for the PR. I've slightly modified the text and removed the code samples as it's absolutely common practice in our code base and devkit must help you when you know the name of the extension to fill every attribute you have. Merged manually
