859,IDEA-198933: Fix painting of splash screen progress bar
2018-09-14T20:41:52Z,discuss,"On Windows HiDPI mode (JRE managed) with a fractional scaling
factor (e.g. 1.5), the progress tail shows as garbled pixels instead
of a semi transparent icon."
2018-09-14T20:41:52Z,discuss,There were 2 HiDPI specific issue when loading the tail icon
2018-09-14T20:41:52Z,discuss,"The icon should allow fractional scaling, otherwise it is just scaled
too much (scaling of 2.0 instead of 1.5 for a 1.5 monitor scaling)"
2018-09-14T20:41:52Z,discuss,"The icon image should be wrapped into a JBImageIcon, so that paintIcon
method ends up calling into a HiDPI aware paint method."
