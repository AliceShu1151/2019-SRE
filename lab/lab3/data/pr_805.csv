805,Delete to the first newline after indexToDeleteTo
2018-06-07T19:28:03Z,discuss,"Instead of the first one before. Doing that can still leave partial log
messages which break Android Studio."

2018-06-07T19:34:12Z,discuss,Remember me? I think we're gonna have to resize to the first newline after indexToDeleteTo instead of before because we're still getting uncaught java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter exceptions from partial dates left in Android Studio logcat messages. I added unit tests this time and LogConsoleBaseTest.resizeBufferIndexToDeleteToIsInFirstMessage will fail if you resize to the newline before.

2018-06-08T18:03:34Z,discuss,Thanks for the test! I've merged manually with small re-refactoring to avoid unnecessary changes (so the place where the change was made is evident)
