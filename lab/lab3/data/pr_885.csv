2018-10-18T11:44:12Z,discuss,"Oh,  sorry, I wasn't aware of this activity. Yes, I'd say calling request on a disposed alarm is a pre-condition violation (and ""assertion failed"" is an expected result of it), and removePropertyChangeListener fix should be enough."
2018-10-18T11:44:12Z,discuss,"Let's wait for @develar to merge the revert, though, as he owns the code."

2018-11-07T06:36:02Z,discuss,"Does this extra check leads to any runtime issues? Or because this check hides  real issues like ""and ""assertion failed"" is an expected result of it)""?"
2018-11-07T06:53:17Z,discuss,I'm not aware of any problems encountered yet but I get the impression it's not what should be done in principle.
