777,Resize myOriginalDocument to a message boundary
2018-04-11T01:03:29Z,discuss,"Android Studio overrides LogConsoleBase.getOriginalDocument to work around
the referenced issue. The override deletes additional characters up to and
including the next newline so the Studio logcat message parsers don't break."

2018-04-11T15:06:55Z,discuss,Eugene doesn't work at JB anymore. I'll try to help if I can. What would be the fix in AS with help of opened document/editor? I would prefer to expose api and not the implementation details which are represented by document/editor in this case. Thanks

2018-04-11T20:29:10Z,discuss,"For the record, I'm a total GitHub newbie, so please bear with me. I pushed a new commit with effectively the same fix I had in Studio. Let me know what you think, thanks!"
2018-04-12T15:39:38Z,discuss,I ask what would you like to do with exposed document and editor assuming you have access to them. Is there any commits with the changes? I see only one commit from you. Thanks
2018-04-12T18:56:10Z,discuss,I uploaded a commit to our external Gerrit so you can see what I'm trying to do. I'm overriding getOriginalDocument to do what the superclass version does and adding my custom buffer resizing logic. I reference myOriginalDocument and getEditor in the override.
