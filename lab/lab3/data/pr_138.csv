138,"add menu item ""Navigation"" -> ""Scroll from source"""
2013-12-06T13:39:13Z,discuss,"Actually, the only reason the item was added - to get an ability to assign keyboard shortcut on it.
Use case follows: I have a project with huge source tree. And I want to see files in the same folder for source file I edit. Navigation project tree is way simpler than using navigation bar (with Alt+Home). And I should move mouse twice - first to icon 'scroll to source' in pane, and the second to files in tree.
With this change one may assign shortcut on 'scroll to source' (or whatever you name it), to save some time."

"
2013-12-06T13:39:13Z,discuss,"ps. I added support for this menu item in project view and groovy mvc project view both. Luckly without any troubles.
pps. maybe it's a good ide to disable action (menu item) while scroll-from-source providers won't response to action."
2013-12-06T23:08:31Z,discuss,This functionality already exists: View | Select In | Project View (Alt-F1 1 in the default keymap).
2013-12-07T13:03:46Z,discuss,"That's good. I just wanted to short the way in first place. With Alt+F1 it require even more actions. So I should look into it (because it works in many places, say ""changes"" tool window) to form a plugin to just assign shortcut for 'select in project view' without popups.
The second - this change is not limited to project view, but any component or plugin that export ScrollFromSourceProvider."
2013-12-07T13:03:46Z,discuss,"btw, I like the way how it's being organized:"
2013-12-07T13:03:46Z,discuss,"At the end, I don't insist on this pull request, cause I have way more to deal with. Repo owner may close this any time."
2013-12-07T13:08:03Z,discuss,"I think, making able to assign a shortcut to an item from Alt+F1 popup would be the best decision."
2013-12-07T14:22:35Z,discuss,"unfortunately, I wasn't able to find that item in keymap"
2013-12-07T14:35:32Z,discuss,"That's because items from Alt+F1 are not actions.
I mean: a change in the code could be not creating a dedicated action for ""Scroll from Source"", but making all of Alt+F1 items to be actions, which would automatically put them into the keymap."
2013-12-07T23:34:38Z,discuss,"yes, my fault - i got it wrong, sorry.
will look into that"
2013-12-07T23:35:24Z,discuss,may i close this pull?
