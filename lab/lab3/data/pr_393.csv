2016-04-26T12:36:42Z,discuss,"If you use renaming, .class field access and assertions don't decompile correctly in some cases (output contains synthetics)."

2016-04-26T12:36:42Z,discuss,"The examples are part of this pull request: #390
They are deactivate in the pull by default because they fail without this fix."
2016-04-26T12:36:42Z,discuss,"Example B needs the first commit of this pull to work (access to .class on renamed class).
Example A also needs the 2nd commit of this pull to work (Assertion location is not recognized as Assertion without adding renaming there)."
2016-04-26T12:36:42Z,discuss,The question is if this is the correct fix or if these 2 problems mean something does not work as it should?
