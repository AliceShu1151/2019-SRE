903,IDEA-201317: Add Cucumber4 Formatter
2018-10-27T16:39:38Z,discuss,Add the ability to see tests executing in realtime as per current Cucumber3 Behaviour. Currently IntelliJ only displays test results at the end of the complete test run.
2018-10-27T16:39:38Z,discuss,See details tracked here: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-201317
2018-10-27T16:39:38Z,discuss,Added a new Cucumber formatter module that implements the ConcurrentEventListener interface
2018-10-27T16:39:38Z,discuss,NB. No attempt has been made to make this threadsafe as the current IDE plugin for cucumber does not pass the new --threads option and therefore cucumber defaults to a single thread. If this functionality is required then further changes will need to be made.
2018-10-27T16:39:38Z,discuss,Also note the cucumber plugin will need to be updated to pass the new Formatter package name.
2018-12-12T14:14:35Z,discuss,"@avokin Hi Andrey, I have made the changes as per our discussion. I will raise the changes for org.jetbrains.plugins.cucumber.java.run.CucumberJavaRunConfigurationProducer separately."
