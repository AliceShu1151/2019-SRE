2019-03-01T12:05:37Z,discuss,"This adds my inspection suppressor at https://github.com/jansorg/pycharm-flake8 to the PyCharm community sources, as requested by the PyCharm team."
2019-06-04T09:04:53Z,discuss,@east825 Is it still likely that the flake8 changes will be merged into intellij-community?
2019-06-04T10:01:22Z,discuss,"Yes, sure! Sorry for this awful delay. There were some performance and applicability scope concerns because of which we decided not to include them in master right away. These changes together with further tweaks are still on an internal review. We will get back to them soon as we're approaching 2019.2 release. Once again, sorry for keeping you waiting "
