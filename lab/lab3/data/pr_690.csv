690,Make isImplicitReturnStatement public
2017-12-19T14:29:06Z,discuss,"Call me a crazy liberal, but is there any reason this method shouldn't be public like the others in this helper class?"
2017-12-19T14:29:06Z,discuss,"I ended up wanting this method for a custom Annotator, and had to just re-implement it inside my plugin. Yay open source, but why not just let people use it where it is, and thus get updates to the code as well?"
2018-01-03T19:29:47Z,discuss,This method should belong to some utility class then. ControlFlowUtils is a good candidate.
