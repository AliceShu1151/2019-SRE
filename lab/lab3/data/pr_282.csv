282,Gradle wrapper location fix IDEA-145249
2015-07-02T20:16:32Z,discuss,"IDEA fails to locate the gradle wrapper at project import if there is a settings.gradle in the parent directory.
It finds the wrapper, but then ignores its own detection and delegates to Gradle tooling API, which looks for it in the parent directory and fails.
A related PR was submitted to Gradle: gradle/gradle#474"

2015-07-03T16:42:09Z,discuss,"CA was received, thank you."
2015-07-09T15:02:47Z,discuss,it looks like gradle tooling api issue and should be handled at gradle side.
2015-07-09T20:14:55Z,discuss,Not really.
2015-07-09T20:14:55Z,discuss,"True, gradle tooling could do a better job at detecting the wrapper location, but it is IDEA that ignores it in the first place. This only happens when DEFAULT_WRAPPED is selected."
2015-07-09T20:14:55Z,discuss,"IDEA detects the settings correctly, but throws them away at the last moment, and defers to Gradle tooling."
2015-07-09T20:14:55Z,discuss,This PR fixes it.
2018-07-21T14:54:20Z,discuss,"@idlsoft, please rebase the PR, cc @vladsoroka."
2018-07-21T21:53:06Z,discuss,"@ignatov @vladsoroka
Done"
2019-06-23T00:17:49Z,discuss,@vladsoroka you marked the associated ticket IDEA-145249 as resolved in 2015. does it mean that this Pull Request is no longer needed and can be safely closed?
2019-06-23T00:17:49Z,discuss,@ignatov why do you (A) ask @idlsoft for more contribution on a problem that is solved years ago and then (B) continue to ignore this pull request after the update?
2019-06-23T04:28:06Z,discuss,"FWIW the PR is still relevant.
IDEA doesn't pick up the correct wrapper, when a master directory is being used."
