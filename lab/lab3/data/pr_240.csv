2015-02-02T15:50:50Z,discuss,"Actually I'm thinking it could make more sense to rebuild the old jna library with this patch: https://people.freebsd.org/~jkim/jna.diff
This would fix not only this issue, but also other libraries (pty4j, jtermios, etc.) that uses jna to load the libc. What's your opinion?"
2015-02-02T16:33:51Z,discuss,Sounds reasonable. Just need to check what holds us back from JNA upgrade.
2015-02-13T14:37:45Z,discuss,Status update: we're in the process of migrating to JNA 4.1 - upgrading and checking dependent libraries one-by-one.
2015-09-21T17:41:31Z,discuss,Finished the migration to JNA 4.1 (finally :/). Sorry for it to take so long.
