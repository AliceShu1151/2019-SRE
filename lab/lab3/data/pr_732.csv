732,Fixed incorrect handling of nested branch locations in SVN plugin
2018-02-11T18:23:19Z,discuss,"SVN plugin incorrectly handles cases when one branch location is a subdirectory or another. I.e. in a project I am working on, we extended the standard repository layout (trunk, branches, tags) with a subdirectory for each team inside branches.
