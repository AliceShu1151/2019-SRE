1106,Fix bug in BuildOutputInstantReaderImpl
2019-03-29T03:44:38Z,discuss,"The bug is that the buffer size stops at 50 though myCurrentIndex keeps
going up. So after finishing reading 50 lines, myCurrentIndex would
always go over the buffer size, in which case getCurrentLine() would
always return null."
