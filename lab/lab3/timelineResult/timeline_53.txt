* content: Changing from SINGLE_TREE_SELECTION to DISCONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION allows the user to press CTRL+A to select every node in the tree and afterwards he can press SPACE to select all check boxes. I don't expect any bad side effects but I am not a Swing expert.

* content: Dear IntelliJ Team,
* time: 2013-03-14T20:10:12Z
* content: this pull request adds an Expand All / Collapse All toolbar button.
* time: 2013-03-14T20:10:12Z
* content: If you want to propagate an exception to all methods in a deep call hierarchy it can be automatically expanded which saves a lot of time.
* time: 2013-03-14T20:10:12Z
* content: The only problem is, that it can take a lot of time if the hierarchy is very big and I don't know yet how to display a progress bar which let's the user cancel the operation.
* time: 2013-03-14T20:10:12Z
* content: It would be nice if you could add this functionality to IntelliJ. Thanks.
* time: 2013-03-14T20:10:12Z
* content: Best regards

* content: I don't think this is valuable. The "Expand all" action does take a huge amount of time for a large call graph, and propagating the exception to a large call hierarchy without any review is most certainly a bad idea.
