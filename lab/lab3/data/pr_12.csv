12,Fix JFlex's Action.GENERAL_LOOK lookahead option to work with --charAt and --sliceandcharat
2012-07-30T04:07:08Z,discuss,"The if block that handled Action.GENERAL_LOOK was assuming zzBufferL was an array and accessing zzBufferL.length and zzBufferL[]. If JFlex was used with the --charAt and --sliceandcharat options, the generated code would not compile since zzBufferL would be a CharSequence."
