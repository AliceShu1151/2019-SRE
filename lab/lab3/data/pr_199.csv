2014-07-08T04:10:31Z,discuss,The problem was due myTabbedPane is always null when there are not tabs (Editor / Editor Tabs / Tab Appearance set to none) therefor never requesting focus.
2014-07-08T04:10:31Z,discuss,I added a else case to make use of IdeFocusManager so it will use the findInstanceByComponent with the current panel and then request the focus to the editor.
