810,Have common Icons for nodes in build view
2018-06-15T14:38:24Z,discuss,"When there are multiple builds on the build view, each one of them get
its Icon from AbstractViewManager#getIcon, but the icons used are not
consistent with the ones used in ExecutionNode."
2018-06-15T14:38:24Z,discuss,"This change causes getIcon to use a new function (getEventResultIcon)
that shares the same icons as ExecutionNode#getCurrentIcon. Also, the
icons are defined using constants to cause any change on them to be used
in both functions."
