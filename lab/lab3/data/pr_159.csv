159,Add extension point for preprocessing of inner class usages
2014-03-12T11:34:53Z,discuss,Add usages processor (with corresponding extension point) which is invoked when inner class is moved to top level. The goal is to provide other languages with a way to modify constructor invocations (e.g. in Kotlin A().B() should become B(A())).
