2017-12-28T18:44:11Z,discuss,So why do you need these extension points?
2017-12-29T11:24:28Z,discuss,"I'm developing EmojiPrefix Plugin. but When I attach emoji to commit message, I couldn't put JPanel in dialogs.
There is a way to hook Toolbar action on my plugin, but I don't think that is a good way."
2017-12-30T16:53:11Z,discuss,Have you tried to use the CommitMessage class or CommitMessageI interface available e.g. from the VcsDataKeys.COMMIT_MESSAGE_CONTROL DataKey.
2017-12-31T01:00:10Z,discuss,VcsDataKeys.COMMIT_MESSAGE_CONTROL need DataContext or DataProvider. but It doesn't gave from Git4Idea.
2018-03-18T12:39:25Z,discuss,Sorry for a delay. So what's the problem of getting the COMMIT_MESSAGE_CONTROL from the DataContext? Could you please point me to the exact place in the code where you'd like to modify the commit message?
2018-03-18T13:39:54Z,discuss,"I want to add JPanel to those dialogs, and i want to change commit message when those dialogs are close."
2018-06-04T13:15:39Z,discuss,"It doesn't seem reasonable to customize all these dialogs separately, but it makes sense to allow plugins to provide custom commit message components. So I've created corresponding tasks - IDEA-193251, IDEA-193252."
2018-06-04T13:15:39Z,discuss,"As for the solution you could use right now. You could try overriding corresponding git actions, like"
2018-06-04T13:15:39Z,discuss,In your actions you could get access to the corresponding dialogs and update commit message components as you need.
