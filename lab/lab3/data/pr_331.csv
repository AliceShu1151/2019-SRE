331,Optimize setting watch roots.
2015-12-04T17:26:48Z,discuss,"The file system operations in local file system and canonical path map
can be slow when done in serial for a large number of roots. Run
these in parallel on an executor."
2015-12-04T17:26:48Z,discuss,"On our benchmarks with about 8000 roots this saves ~700ms, or about 70%,
when setting watch roots."

2015-12-04T19:50:53Z,discuss,Let me know if there's a better way to execute a bunch of tasks in parallel than what I added in ParallelUtil. Application#executeOnPooledThread isn't happy to accept 1000 tasks at once without starting to dump threads.
2015-12-05T19:43:05Z,discuss,I updated the pull request to use BoundedTaskExecutor and removed the guava dependency. Benchmarks look the same.
2015-12-05T20:35:49Z,discuss,Thanks! I added couple of comments inline

2015-12-07T16:27:44Z,discuss,I changed the containers to ContainerUtil and iterate futures in reverse order.
2015-12-09T16:11:01Z,discuss,Have you had a chance to look at this? Muchos gracias!
2015-12-10T19:27:40Z,discuss,Pushed upstream. Thanks!
