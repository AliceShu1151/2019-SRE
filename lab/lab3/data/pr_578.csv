2017-05-27T01:31:54Z,discuss,"This fix constrains the output options to just three (debug, info and warn) matching the options available in apache maven (--debug, --quiet and for no option, everything). This avoids ambiguity and makes the UI simpler. Existing tests work fine and no new tests were needed."
