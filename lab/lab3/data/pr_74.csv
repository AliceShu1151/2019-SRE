74,"Update tip of the day, fix invalid menu items, shortcuts, typos"
2013-04-21T17:33:39Z,discuss,"Hi IntelliJ team,"
2013-04-21T17:33:39Z,discuss,"I went through all tip of the day of IntelliJ Ultimate 12.1.1 and corrected a few mistakes.
Unfortunately a lot of images in the tips aren't displayed if I build IntelliJ Community Edition by myself
Environment: Windows 7 32 Bit, Java 6/7, latest source version from github
Failed: images/ctrl_shift_i_lookup.gif
Success: images/properties_completion.gif"
2013-04-21T17:33:39Z,discuss,The images are shown correctly if I use the packaged version from Jetbrains. Is this normal?
2013-04-21T17:33:39Z,discuss,It would be nice if you would include this patch in one of the following releases.
