1268,[Gradle] Always create tooling model copy for GradleExtensions.
2019-12-05T21:02:04Z,discuss,"With custom serialization, multiple projects can share the same instance
of tooling model after serialization, because the serialization mechanism
uses hashcode as identifier to avoid re-creating objects. While two projects
can have the same hashcode if their fields are identical."
2019-12-05T21:02:04Z,discuss,"This will cause problems if the shared tooling model is updated by one project,
and then all projects sharing that instance will get unintended change."
2019-12-05T21:02:04Z,discuss,"For example, with GradleExtensions model, each project adds their
own task list to the same instance of GradleExtensions."
2019-12-05T21:02:04Z,discuss,Fix the problem by always making a copy of the de-serialized model.
