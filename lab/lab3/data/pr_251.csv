2015-03-06T15:01:13Z,discuss,"And have you submitted a contributor license agreement as well? If not, please download the PDF from http://www.jetbrains.org/display/IJOS/Contributor+Agreement and then print it out, sign (mention you github account name there), scan and email to contribute@jetbrains.com"
2015-03-06T15:04:19Z,discuss,Hi @klikh as far as I know I've did that as I already have a Confluence account and rights to edit the IntelliJ space on it.
2015-03-06T16:16:23Z,discuss,"Well, if you're not a JetBrains employee and if you didn't send a scanned contribution agreement yet, you should do it. That's actually what is mentioned in the contributing.md :)"
2015-03-08T11:16:31Z,discuss,@klikh I've sent it by fax on 21.11.2014. Should I send it by mail as well?
2015-03-10T11:31:19Z,discuss,"It seems that we didn't receive it by fax: I've just asked our colleague to double-check, and they confirmed the fact. Could you please resend it by e-mail? Thanks."
