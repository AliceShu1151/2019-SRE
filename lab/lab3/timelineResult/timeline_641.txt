* content: Fix for issue https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-144811
* time: 2017-10-08T17:20:08Z
* content: There are currently application-wide settings for: (1) the path to the git executable and (2) the choice of ssh executable.  This change honors those existing settings, but allows individual projects to choose to override them.

* content: Thank you for your help, @mkillianey Unfortunately there's a problem with the approach you suggested - not many users know about "default project" setup, so setting up application-wide executable can become a pain in the neck. We have come up with a slightly different approach that allows to "override" current application-wide setting via a checkbox and will implement this shortly.
