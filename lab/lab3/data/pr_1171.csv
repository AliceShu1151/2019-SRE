1171,allow overwrite key completion register
2019-07-12T17:59:08Z,discuss,"I'm extending this module to create an Ansible IDE. And now I'm facing a problem to group suggestions and prioritize keywords before modules.
I'm not able to return a PrioritizedLookupElement from getKeyLookups in my custom Field implementation since it returns a list of LookupElementBuilder. So, the best options is to overwrite YamlMetaTypeCompletionProviderBase#registerBasicKeyCompletion but it's private and static. So, with this PR I'm broadening it to protected and removing the static flag so I'm group the LookupElements before add to CompletionResultSet.
