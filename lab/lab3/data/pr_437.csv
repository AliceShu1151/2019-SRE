437,fix debuggability for ipy notebook kernels
2016-08-11T20:22:57Z,discuss,"the ipy nb kernels are subprocesses launched with -m ipykernel, while pydev generally has problems in debugging -m startups, the simple modification in this PR has enabled me to debug ipy kernels with PyCharm."
2016-08-11T20:22:57Z,discuss,It exploits the fact that __main__ of ipykernel does not fire relative imports as __init__ does. It wouldn't work without this fact.
2016-08-11T20:22:57Z,discuss,However I'm not sure whether running __main__ instead of __init__ for a module will break things in other cases.

2016-08-31T12:42:37Z,discuss,In the current state the pull request can't be merged as it will break the execution of __init__.py files in general.
2016-08-31T12:42:37Z,discuss,"Could you please describe what problem you are solving?
It's better to do that by submitting an issue to our tracker and posting here a link to it:

2016-08-31T13:00:41Z,discuss,Seems there's already one: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-14742
2016-08-31T13:09:47Z,discuss,"@traff I'm just curious in what cases should __init__.py be executed instead of __main__.py for a package when both exist?
I had tried -m for Interpreter options and package name for Script in a run/debug configuration, while it runs okay but debug always fail."
2018-10-16T16:40:34Z,discuss,Does this mean there is potential movement on this issue?
2018-10-16T16:40:34Z,discuss,If we could only:
2018-10-16T16:40:34Z,discuss,... this would at least change the face of scientific computation.
2018-10-16T16:40:34Z,discuss,"As far as I can see, this is the main reason MATLAB is still able to compete in the marketplace.  Also Julia is coming, but it currently lacks this ability also."
2018-10-19T14:21:09Z,discuss,"Hi @p-i-! We're going to update our support for Jupyter Notebooks in PyCharm later, and debugger will be probably added. Feel free to leave comments vote for the issue: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-14742"
2018-10-19T14:24:10Z,discuss,"Hi @complyue! Sorry for the late response. Your fix will break execution for __init__.py files, so it can't be merged. Please, create a separate issue in our issue tracker https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/PY and explain how execution of __main__.py instead of __init__.py is related to notebooks debugging.
Thank you!"
