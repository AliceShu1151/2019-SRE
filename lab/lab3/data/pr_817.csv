I kept stumbling over rephrasing this line in the original file: ""If this git repository is not on 'master' branch you need to checkout the same branches/tags in android and android/tools-base git repositories.""
Hopefully I've clarified the meaning in the new version. Let me know."

I've merged your changes to 'master' branch, they will appear on github in an hour."
