802,Fix path for open command in launcher
2018-06-05T09:30:38Z,discuss,"It's a common pattern for power users to replace open with some other
file manager. Since the launcher relies on the OS open command, having
the full path will avoid issues with users aliasing open to something
else while keeping the current behavior the same."
