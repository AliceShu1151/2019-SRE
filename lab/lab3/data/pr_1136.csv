1136,IDEA-212508: Reduce memory footprint of MultipleBuildsView.myBuildsMap
2019-05-13T00:40:43Z,discuss,The change is based on the observation that build events with java.lang.Object IDs never have child events.

2019-06-06T10:22:09Z,discuss,"The change fixes some issue with the memory footprint of MultipleBuildsView.myBuildsMap, however it looks more like a workaround for the bad events routing implemented for parallel builds.
I'd not add a new method to BuildEvent interface as a workaround.
Please, find the following change at 3a8e9d0
It should do the same as your change but w/o changing of the BuildEvent interface."
