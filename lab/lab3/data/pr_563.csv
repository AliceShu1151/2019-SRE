563,Decompiler: Remove 'Integer.valueOf()' boxing of literals
2017-04-20T20:58:12Z,discuss,This is a continuation of #552.
2017-04-20T20:58:12Z,discuss,Removed Integer.valueOf() boxing of literals whose type is detected as byte or short.
2017-06-21T20:35:26Z,discuss,@gorrus Would you mind checking this?
2017-06-22T16:42:50Z,discuss,"I'm slightly worried that you do setConstType inside isBoxingCall method, this looks like an invisible side effect. Please find a better place for it."
2017-06-22T16:44:28Z,discuss,Please do not do setConstType inside isBoxingCall method
2017-06-23T21:28:56Z,discuss,"I removed setConstType() from isBoxingCall().
I also fixed another bug: narrowing cast was not applied when target type was Byte or Short."
2017-06-23T21:28:56Z,discuss,"On top of that I removed the unboxing calls too. (intValue(), etc.)
This should have probably been done in a separate PR, but I couldn't resist."
