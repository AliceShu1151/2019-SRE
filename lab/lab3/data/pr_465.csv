465,Expose finding class files for alternative bytecode viewers
2016-11-05T18:23:38Z,discuss,The logic of finding the class file that is associated with a PsiElement is non-trivial and can be reused by other bytecode viewers with this simple change.
2016-11-05T18:23:38Z,discuss,Alternative bytecode viewers want to depend on the built-in bytecode viewer anyway because of the classSearcher extension point.

2016-11-08T13:56:23Z,discuss,How the alternative code viewers are integrated? What API they use? Thanks

2016-11-08T14:01:21Z,discuss,"The action and the display are completely different from your plugin, but I
still need to search for the class file for the current selection and make
use of the the classSearcher extension point. Right now, I need to
duplicate your code for finding the class file."

2016-11-08T14:56:06Z,discuss,"So you would have strong dependency on a plugin where the only implementation of mentioned extension point is groovy scripts. I'd rather suggest to move the code outside the plugin, based on containing class. You'll be able still to provide optional dependency on plugin for extensions but even without the bytecode viewer your plugin would work for most of cases. Agree?"
2016-11-08T15:14:46Z,discuss,"Yes, that makes perfect sense and would be much better."

2016-11-09T13:42:01Z,discuss,"Thank you very much, this looks good, I'll use it after 2016.3 is released."
2016-11-09T14:43:33Z,discuss,"That's in master now, 171.+. The change looks simple but still can't be put to the release branch as we are too close to the release date. Sorry"
2016-11-09T17:34:12Z,discuss,"OK, got it, no problem."
