2013-03-26T19:35:32Z,discuss,"I don't think this is a valuable contribution. StringUtil.isEmptyOrSpaces(s) is longer than s.trim().length() == 0 and is not particularly more readable; also, I don't think any of the usages are in performance-critical places so the creation of an extra object by trim() doesn't matter. We could accept a separate pull request that removes the functions which duplicate isEmptyOrSpaces() or nullize() and replaces their usages."
