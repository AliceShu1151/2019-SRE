64,Standard shortcut for expand all / collapse all
2013-03-31T14:58:29Z,discuss,"Member Chooser uses different shortcuts than the standard ones, is this intentional?"
2013-03-31T14:58:29Z,discuss,"StructureViewComponent adds also Expand All / Collapse All but without shortcuts, are these two buttons in the toolbar really necessary, space is always limited and the buttons are already placed in the title?"

I don't think the expand/collapse buttons created by StructureViewComponent are actually displayed anywhere."
