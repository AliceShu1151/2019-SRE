152,libnotifywrapper: Fix crashes when showing notification
2014-02-18T13:18:28Z,discuss,"Fixes IDEA crashing after showing a notification balloon on Ubuntu 12.04. There was a typo in the dlsym call for notify_uninit, and also libnotify must not be dlclosed and dlopened repeatedly."
2014-02-18T15:34:31Z,discuss,Conversation with GTK people:
2014-02-24T16:25:31Z,discuss,Thanks a lot! We will review it soon
2014-02-25T10:03:54Z,discuss,"The notification system was reworked to use JNA (4d26c0a) so the fix is now obsolete.
Thank you anyway!"
2014-03-20T15:41:52Z,discuss,"I get segfaults related to libnotify in IDEA ultimate 13.1, pretty sure this is also using JNA."
2014-03-20T15:51:52Z,discuss,"@facboy any details?
You can disable notifications by putting ""ide.libnotify.enabled=false"" in bin/idea.properties."
2014-03-20T19:37:23Z,discuss,i raised it on the jetbrains forums: http://devnet.jetbrains.com/message/5511841?tstart=0#5511841
2014-03-21T02:50:49Z,discuss,"For @facboy's problem, it seems that the libnotify library is too old and the call signature of notify_notification_new has changed in the meantime."
2014-03-21T02:50:49Z,discuss,libnotify-0.5.0 has:
2014-03-21T02:50:49Z,discuss,but libnotify-0.7.5 (what I have on Ubuntu 12.04) is lacking the last parameter (which the JNA code is written against):
2014-03-21T02:50:49Z,discuss,"What I would try is to either add a version check for libnotify, or change the signature of notify_notification_new to the four-parameter version in the JNA code and always pass in NULL as the widget parameter. The calling convention on Linux is such that passing an extra argument to a function shouldn't technically cause problems, so both versions should work."
2014-03-21T12:47:20Z,discuss,"I've fixed library version to .so.4 so that older version (.so.1) would not be loaded.
Thanks!"
2014-03-21T12:47:20Z,discuss,Upd. the fix will be include in 13.1.2.
2014-03-24T19:03:18Z,discuss,"FYI - I seem to have a very similar issue re: libnotity.so.1
IntelliJ Ultimate 13.1.1 running on linux crashes if I switch windows (alt-tab) during a compile:"
2014-03-24T19:03:18Z,discuss,Will 13.1.2 fix this?
2014-03-24T19:20:02Z,discuss,"It's not just similar - it's the very issue. Yes, 13.1.2 will fix it."
2014-03-24T19:20:32Z,discuss,"@gclayburg you have the exact same crash location and library version as in the crash above, so it's the same issue."
2014-03-24T19:40:57Z,discuss,Awesome.  Thanks guys!
