843,fix extra semicolon in decompiled empty blocks IDEA-196314
2018-07-28T20:34:28Z,discuss,"This should fix the mentioned issue (and also other cases of empty blocks that I didn't consider). I have changed the tests so that they all pass, if there are problems that the tests do not cover I am happy to add more."
2018-07-30T11:19:57Z,discuss,"There's a semicolon param in the method specifically for this case, why not change it to false?"
2018-07-30T13:05:11Z,discuss,"I initially just changed jmpWrapper as it fixed all cases and I couldn't find anything that used it to provide a semicolon correctly. However, some cases with if statements aren't covered by it and it's not a great fix. Hopefully the output formatting is OK."
