1166,DocumentationComponent: Added Base64 image support
2019-07-07T21:38:12Z,discuss,This adds Base64 image support to the DocumentationComponent via data uris.
2019-07-07T21:38:12Z,discuss,Put this into Javadoc:

2019-07-07T21:38:12Z,discuss,Certain competitors are able to show base64 encoded images in JavaDoc. So i think IntelliJ should also be able. At work we use that to display the icons behind String constants in the JavaDoc.
2019-07-07T21:38:12Z,discuss,Also this fixes the following: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-104317
2019-07-12T12:53:22Z,discuss,"Hello, Markus,
Thanks for your contribution. Could you please fix the following problems I've found:"
2019-07-13T14:24:25Z,discuss,"Hello Dmitry,"
2019-07-13T14:24:25Z,discuss,"I tried to keep the logic for normal images by looking at what the swing ImageView does and copying that, but i will work on your notes in the coming days."
2019-07-14T18:55:34Z,discuss,"Hello again @JB-Dmitry.
I implemented the width/height thing and also set the default border size to 0 as you requested. I does behave different to normal images though... Guess the swing ImageView does something strange...

2019-07-14T18:55:34Z,discuss,The Source for this Test:
2019-07-14T18:55:34Z,discuss,"I also took a look at the viewToModel method again and why it is different from the swing.ImageView one. I found the swing.IconView, which matches the MyIconView.viewToModel method again."
2019-07-14T18:55:34Z,discuss,"I'm not sure what version of the method to take, but i went with the ImageView one, as we are displaying a BufferedImage and not just icons. Let me know if that is okay with you."
2019-07-15T11:22:59Z,discuss,"Hello Markus,"
2019-07-15T11:22:59Z,discuss,"Thanks for the updated fix - looks better to me.
As for the image scaling logic in ImageView - it had a bug, which is fixed in JDK 12 (https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8208638) and JetBrains Runtime (https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/JBR-588). You've probably used an older JDK version to test."
2019-07-15T11:22:59Z,discuss,"I see now why you've chosen that particular 'viewToModel' implementation - ImageView has the same one (didn't look at it previously). IMHO, the one in IconView is better, as e.g. a mouse click near the right edge of the image will position the caret at the right edge. But let's leave it as in your implementation, for consistency."
2019-07-15T11:22:59Z,discuss,"I've pushed your change, and also moved the new logic to JBHtmlEditorKit."
