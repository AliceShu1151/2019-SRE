325,Add support for sending a module name to pydevd
2015-11-19T00:34:38Z,discuss,"Previously, the args for a subprocess spawned under debug with a module specified via -m would get rewritten incorrectly, resulting in the -m flag being split from the module name. This resulted in running a command similar to /usr/bin/python -m /path/to/pydevd.py --someargs --file [module], which doesn't work. This removes the -m from that command and adds a --command flag passed to pydevd, which results in correctly running as a module instead of a file."
