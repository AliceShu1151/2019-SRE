2018-11-15T17:55:27Z,discuss,@BasLeijdekkers I just created https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-202323 for it.
2018-11-20T13:53:26Z,discuss,@BasLeijdekkers The next try is ready.
2018-11-20T13:53:26Z,discuss,"Is there a better way for testing different options of one inspection? I'd rather have liked a method doTest(inspection) instead, but currently both calls to getInspection are during the setup phase of the test, and I also didn't find a hook for modifying the inspection before actually applying it."

For next time: please squash all commits into one, this makes merging into our project easier (unfortunately we can't use GitHub's automatic pull request merging).
Thanks again."
