2013-08-27T06:35:18Z,discuss,"I've changed myColumn to be typed as ChangeListColumn<CommittedChangeList>, but the problem is that the column comes from calling com.intellij.openapi.vcs.CommittedChangesProvider#getColumns which isn't typed (it's simply returns ChangeListColumn[]), so somewhere I'll have to cast. For now, I've put that cast in the CustomChangeListColumnGroupingStrategy ctor."
2013-08-27T06:35:18Z,discuss,"An inspection of the implementations of the getColumns() method shows that all the columns returned could be described as `ChangeListColumn<? extends CommittedChangeList>``, but changing the signature of that method is not easy."
2013-08-27T06:35:18Z,discuss,"I've reverted the combobox prototype back to it's original value: getComboBox().setPrototypeDisplayValue(""Date+"");, though I'm happy to remove it altogether if you believe that's the right thing to do."
