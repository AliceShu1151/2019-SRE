2017-03-30T16:25:32Z,discuss,"¡°Sync¡± means ¡°cause (a set of data or files) to remain identical in more than one location.¡± In this case, though, the files aren't intended to be completely identical; in commit a3f7112 idea_default_no_spellchecker.xml differs in two small ways: (1) the profile name has ¡°.no.spellchecker¡± appended, and (2) SpellCheckingInspection is disabled. I preserved those differences here."
2017-03-30T16:25:32Z,discuss,As of recently it's used on our internal CI as well; hence concern about divergence here.
