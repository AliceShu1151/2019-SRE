674,Fix an ildefined comparator in AbstractTreeUi.
2017-12-04T12:32:04Z,discuss,"Hi,"
2017-12-04T12:32:04Z,discuss,"this patch is to fix an ildefined comparator in AbstractTreeUi which causes a lot of crashes related to https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-181904. (#IDEA-181904) However, please note that the patch does not fix the problem entirely. I suspect it is not the root cause but just something triggered by too many null descriptors or similar.
