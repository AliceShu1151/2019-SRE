524,Avoid deregistering roots that will registered again in fsNotifier
2017-03-02T17:07:41Z,discuss,"The current behavior is that once a new set of roots is received,
all the current roots were first deregistered and then
the new ones registered."

sets, this causes two issues:"
2017-03-02T17:07:41Z,discuss,Performance overhead
2017-03-02T17:07:41Z,discuss,"Loss of event if it happened after deregistering
before registering"
2017-03-02T17:07:41Z,discuss,"To avoid those issues, the set of current and new roots
can be compared and only new roots registered and
only the old roots no longer present deregistered."
