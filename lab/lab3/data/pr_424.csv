2016-07-14T09:20:55Z,discuss,"I see that you've at first closed this pull request right after creation, and then reopened it a week later. But Github doesn't show any new/rewritten commits here. You just wanted to test it more, or you closed it by accident?"
2016-07-14T09:23:25Z,discuss,"Yes, I just wanted PR to be first reviewed by my colleagues, but accidentally created it in JetBrains repo instead of my fork"
2016-07-17T08:29:10Z,discuss,Merged the patch with a few mentioned corrections. Thanks a lot!
2016-07-18T10:21:09Z,discuss,"Ah. Together we missed the fact that the linked reference can reside in .git/packed-refs. Currently it leads to RepoStateException: Couldn't load file /Users/loki/temp/t/.git/refs/heads/master.
Seems that this fix can't be easily adjusted. Temporary reverted."
2016-07-18T10:48:00Z,discuss,And how can this happen? symbolic-ref in origin?
2016-07-18T15:44:44Z,discuss,"git pack-refs --all makes everything packed, including refs/heads/master thus the code can't find .git/refs/heads/master written in .git/HEAD."
2016-07-18T15:44:44Z,discuss,"It seems that to solve the issue we'll have first to read all references to a map, both from .git/refs and .git/packed-refs, and then resolve them by following links inside the map."
2016-07-18T15:53:23Z,discuss,"Thank you, I'll try to do something with this."
2016-07-18T15:59:08Z,discuss,"Cool, thanks. I've written a test which reveals the issue."
