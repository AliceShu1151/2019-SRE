1024,IDEA-204998: Use decompile classes in preference to library classes
2019-01-05T02:55:57Z,discuss,Fixes https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-204998
2019-11-13T07:28:38Z,discuss,The change in behavior not only makes sense but due to it's current state it has caused critical issues that have caused me to have to find alternatives to FernFlower in the past. The approach he took to resolving the issue is extremely straight forward with very predictable side effects.
