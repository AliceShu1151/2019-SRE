* content: Fix NPE when decompiling constructor with call to the absent constructor of the same class.

* content: @gorrus we need an option which would allow decompiling incorrect code (off by default, on in IdeaDecompiler).
* time: 2017-10-25T16:51:52Z
* content: @trespasserw we do not stop on such errors, just the failing method is marked as // $FF: Couldn't be decompiled
* time: 2017-10-25T16:59:05Z
* content: @Maccimo please describe when do you need it. Why constructors are better than any other methods in this case?
* time: 2017-10-26T00:44:20Z
* content: @gorrus The question is not clear. Need what?
* time: 2017-10-26T00:44:20Z
* content: As long as I can see only call to the absent constructor of the class from one of methods of class itself (not only <init>)  will cause decompilation problem.
* time: 2017-10-26T00:44:20Z
* content: Concerning suggestion of @trespasserw I personally think it would be handy to show disassembly in such cases.
* time: 2017-10-26T08:51:06Z
* content: @Maccimo I will clarify: in what cases do you decompile classes with missing constructor calls? Is it possible that other methods are missing but being called?
* time: 2017-10-26T22:20:56Z
* content: This particular bug was revealed while debugging code generation tool. Obviously, it is possible that any method or field may be missed while it is not causing class loading problems.
* time: 2017-10-26T22:20:56Z
* content: I saw other places in decompiler where result returned by getMethodWrapper() is dereferenced without nullability check, but not investigated that places yet.
