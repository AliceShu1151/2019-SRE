557,Added frame name passing to PyPositionConverter
2017-04-17T16:26:08Z,discuss,We have our own PyPositionConverter implementation that requires frame name
2017-04-25T18:53:42Z,discuss,Why do you need frame name? Can it be generalized somehow?
2017-04-25T19:57:10Z,discuss,We have an in-house graph framework that essentially rewrites the evaluation order of code to be evaluated in excel-like manner. It creates synthetic frames that needs special handling and translation. We can identify those frames based on the name.
