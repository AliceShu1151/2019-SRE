130,PY-11317 Incorrect type detection for formatter string with java String ...
2013-11-22T10:36:13Z,discuss,"Improve skeleton generator to using predefined return type in the doc generator
via user  PREDEFINED_MOD_CLASS_SIGS map."
2013-11-22T10:36:13Z,discuss,"The main issue which is exists here related to that the str or unicode
in mod method don't have any return type in the doc string."
2013-11-22T10:36:13Z,discuss,We have such things:
2013-11-22T10:36:13Z,discuss,"After applying 1 option I think that everything should work. But not =(
It seems that doc string have more priority then returned type (?) =("
2013-11-22T10:36:13Z,discuss,"Thus I also perform operation of adding additional description to the doc
which describe return type in format which idea is parsing.
Please note that such behavior performs only for
PREDEFINED_MOD_CLASS_SIGS map"
2013-11-22T10:36:13Z,discuss,After regenerating the skeleton we have such picture:
2013-11-22T10:36:13Z,discuss,And Idea detects correct type for formating string behavior.
2013-11-26T14:52:41Z,discuss,A better place for this fix is python-skeletons.
2013-12-02T14:36:15Z,discuss,"Do you mean python/skeletons folder? To fix this you proposed update
such skeletons:"
2013-12-02T14:36:15Z,discuss,"If not, could you please describe a little bit more where the better
place to fix this?"
2013-12-02T14:44:54Z,discuss,No. Please take a look at JetBrains/python-skeletons repo. The idea behind Python skeletons + how to use/modify them is described in README.md.
2013-12-02T14:58:43Z,discuss,"Ahhh... Thanks a lot... So this possible fix is not convenient for plugin/pycharm?
Should I close it?"

2013-12-02T15:53:49Z,discuss,"Issue after using python-skeletons is reproduce... Reopen
It seems stubs which is generated have more priority then
python-skeletons...."
2013-12-02T15:53:49Z,discuss,Any suggestions how to fix this?
2013-12-02T22:07:44Z,discuss,Resolve issue with python-skeletons after perform such steps:
2013-12-02T22:07:44Z,discuss,Close again... Sorry for this monologue =)
