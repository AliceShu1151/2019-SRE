654,Fix NPE when decompiling constructor
2017-10-25T05:25:54Z,discuss,Fix NPE when decompiling constructor with call to the absent constructor of the same class.
2017-10-25T14:14:09Z,discuss,"@gorrus we need an option which would allow decompiling incorrect code (off by default, on in IdeaDecompiler)."
2017-10-25T16:51:52Z,discuss,"@trespasserw we do not stop on such errors, just the failing method is marked as // $FF: Couldn't be decompiled"
2017-10-25T16:59:05Z,discuss,@Maccimo please describe when do you need it. Why constructors are better than any other methods in this case?
2017-10-26T00:44:20Z,discuss,@gorrus The question is not clear. Need what?
2017-10-26T00:44:20Z,discuss,As long as I can see only call to the absent constructor of the class from one of methods of class itself (not only <init>)  will cause decompilation problem.
2017-10-26T00:44:20Z,discuss,Concerning suggestion of @trespasserw I personally think it would be handy to show disassembly in such cases.
2017-10-26T08:51:06Z,discuss,@Maccimo I will clarify: in what cases do you decompile classes with missing constructor calls? Is it possible that other methods are missing but being called?
2017-10-26T22:20:56Z,discuss,"This particular bug was revealed while debugging code generation tool.
Obviously, it is possible that any method or field may be missed while it is not causing class loading problems."
2017-10-26T22:20:56Z,discuss,"I saw other places in decompiler where result returned by getMethodWrapper() is dereferenced without nullability check, but not investigated that places yet."
