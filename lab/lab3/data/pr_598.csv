2017-07-09T23:45:56Z,discuss,Fixed according to review
2017-07-11T03:42:34Z,discuss,I've made the changes but maybe we can do even better if we can avoid creating stubs for instance attributes entirely by getting rid of:
2017-07-11T03:42:34Z,discuss,"Inside 'PyTargetExpressionElementType'. However, I'm not sure if this is needed by any custom stub types or not."
2017-07-12T19:47:52Z,discuss,"@fitermay The stubs for instance attributes are used heavily. For example, look into PyClassImpl.findInstanceAttribute(): it comes down to PyClassImpl.getTargetExpressions(PyFunction) that finds the target expression children of the function stub."
2017-07-12T20:00:57Z,discuss,@fitermay Thanks for your PR! I've cherry-picked it into master. It will go through QA and is likely to appear in the next major version after 2017.2.
