492,Make RunContentManagerImpl.DESCRIPTOR_KEY public
2016-12-12T13:35:34Z,discuss,"Rationale: I'm writing a plugin for a profiler integration which defines its own executor. Apart from the live profiling runs that are associated with a console, I want to add other tabs for snapshots and attach sessions to the tool window that have a different layout without any console. Content objects in the tool window need a user data value with the above key, otherwise an exception is thrown."
