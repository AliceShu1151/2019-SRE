453,Fix memory leak inside the Gradle daemon caused by Idea Gradle plugin
2016-10-12T11:12:14Z,discuss,This fixes a memory leak inside the Gradle daemon caused by Idea Gradle plugin.
2016-10-12T11:12:14Z,discuss,"Here's a description of the memory leak:
The custom classloader created by ijinit.gradle was not garbage collected and it was keeping references to a lot of object instances. The instances were held in the static ExtraModelBuilder.buildersLoader field. This field referenced an instance of ExternalProjectBuilderImpl which has a cache field with a lot of instances.
Each new call using the same Gradle daemon instance would leak more memory."
