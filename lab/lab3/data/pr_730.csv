730,Improve operations for document listeners
2018-02-11T14:48:31Z,discuss,Purpose
2018-02-11T14:48:31Z,discuss,Currently access to myDocumentListeners is prohibited so I implemented 2 public methods in DocumentImpl.
2018-02-11T14:48:31Z,discuss,Thanks.
2018-02-16T09:49:18Z,discuss,"Why do you need this? Note that you can track yourself whether you've added your listener or not. Double addition/removal is probably a bug somewhere in the client, and the new API would obscure that bug."

Thank you for comments!"
2018-02-16T10:36:51Z,discuss,"My plugin will add documentListener and remove it every time several specific events happen. Of course I can manage these things by myself but it makes my code complicated. To simplify it, I wanted to access myDocumentListeners to verify whether it is already added or removed but I made new public methods instead."
2018-02-16T10:36:51Z,discuss,"Hmm, I thought if there are no special reasons then developers can choose to use existing methods so that they can detect double addition/removal."
2018-02-16T11:39:47Z,discuss,Unfortunately people too often invoke a method with convenient-looking name without giving much thought :(
2018-02-16T12:04:48Z,discuss,"I understood.
Then how about making public boolean existDocumentListener(@NotNull DocumentListener listener)?
(1) If people invoke this method without giving much thought but I believe it will not obscure bugs.
(2) People can easily implement simple codes to verify whether a listener has already added or not."
2018-02-16T12:04:48Z,discuss,"But if you still think this method produces bad result or it is not needed in core API then I will close PR, if not then I will update codes. (If you have better method name, plz let me know)"
2018-02-19T20:22:19Z,discuss,"I think the existence of such a method doesn't promote better practices of working with document listeners, with clean install/remove lifecycle, preferably with a parent disposable. So I'd prefer not to add such method to API, sorry."

OK, thank you for the comment. Let me close this PR."
