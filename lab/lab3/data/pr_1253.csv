2019-11-18T15:32:25Z,discuss,It looks like you are doing to some nice work on type migration. But it would be even better if you could add some tests for the bugs you are fixing. Look at com.intellij.refactoring.AllTypeMigrationTestSuite to find existing test cases.
2019-11-18T15:32:25Z,discuss,Thanks!
