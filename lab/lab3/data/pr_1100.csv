1100,IDEA-209622: VCS Ignore minor changes option
2019-03-25T23:52:21Z,discuss,"VCS Ignore minor changes option: some VCS changes (e.g. git commit, or github PR) contains only cosmetic changes like formatting, line ending and/or imports reformatting: diff view for those files shows no changes due to used text ignore settings. It makes review and search over vcs history harder."
2019-03-25T23:52:21Z,discuss,"This PR adds option to ignore minor (in terms of used text ignore settings) changes to VCS History, Github PR, and other VCS-related changes."
