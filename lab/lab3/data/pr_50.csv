Could you check  if this bug is still reproduced in this case, please?"
2013-03-18T18:36:32Z,discuss,"Of course, the system locale has selected Japanese.
The problem is that the read and write the commit log fixed character set cp1251.
In Windows, the character code for Japanese is cp932.
However, mojibake occurs because the character code is incorrect.
Please see the following for mojibake.
