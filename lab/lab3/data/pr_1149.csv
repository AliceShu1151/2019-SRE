1149,Support contributed references for the ShVariable PSI element
2019-06-04T09:23:10Z,discuss,This PR adds support for contributed references to the ShVariable implementation. Variables can be resolved to definitions and this adds the possibility to let extensions contribute references.
2019-06-04T09:23:10Z,discuss,I'm following the style which is used by other elements of the sh.bnf grammar.
2019-10-16T08:21:51Z,discuss,"@ignatov This is a new take to allow 3rd-party plugins to provide references for a ShVariable. It now uses ShSupport to get the references.
The default value is the same as before, i.e. no references."
2019-10-16T08:21:51Z,discuss,It would be great to allow other plugins to provide references for variables which are not supported by Sh.
2019-10-16T08:21:51Z,discuss,Please let me know if this isn't what you'd like to merge.
