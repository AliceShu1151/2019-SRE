1261,Pass along existing progress indicator if one exists.
2019-11-22T17:56:41Z,discuss,"Running a plugin in headless mode, this is overriding my progress bar I have configured to pipe the progress to the terminal. Can't think of a reason we cant use the existing one if it exists."
2019-11-25T05:55:51Z,discuss,"Could you please add a test for the behavior you need, probably to ProgressIndicatorTest?"
2019-11-25T17:21:56Z,discuss,"Thanks for taking a look Peter. I have added a test for the write action case, however (please correct me if there is a way), I could not find a way to test the headless && !unitTest case (the case I will use this for)."
2019-11-27T17:44:34Z,discuss,"Yes, writing tests in !unitTestMode is nontrivial and seems not worth the effort here."
2019-11-28T08:54:45Z,discuss,"Great, thanks! Do you need this in 2019.3?"
2019-11-28T11:17:44Z,discuss,"Interestingly, this leads to a failure in a couple tests in Ultimate. So far I haven't investigated why."

2019-11-28T20:29:30Z,discuss,"Weird, I did check the other tests and didn't see any new failures. I assume ultimate tests are internal only. Let me know if there is anything I can do to help."
2019-11-28T20:29:30Z,discuss,Thanks again for your help looking at this.
