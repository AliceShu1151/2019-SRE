542,IDEA-140862 Extend DefaultMutableTreeNode to support restoring tree selection.
2017-04-08T20:32:05Z,discuss,"DefaultMutableTreeNode does not implement equals() and hashCode().
Because of that it is impossible to re-apply stored selection after re-building tree model."
2017-04-08T20:32:05Z,discuss,"A new sub-class implements these methods (delegating the calls to ""user object"").
This fixes the selection reset when changing the filter in ""Version Control > Repository"" view."
2017-04-14T02:24:37Z,discuss,"Would not recommend doing the lambda expression instead of just the anonymous interfaces, as adding lambda's would essentially make those classes java 8 dependent which might not be for the best."
2017-04-14T16:40:32Z,discuss,@Notoh Why is it not for the best? The vcs-impl module is already fully under Java 8.
2017-04-14T18:51:12Z,discuss,"Lambdas won't add anything other than slight readability (at least in this instance alone) which can sacrifice compatibility if this were to be used with java 7 or earlier.
Because it is java 8 already, at the end of the day its just semantics about the principal of good practice."
