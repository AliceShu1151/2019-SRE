205,Adds the ability for secondary toolbar buttons to be right aligned.
2014-08-07T16:58:55Z,discuss,"This right aligning is required in Android Studio to right align our Google Login widget -- which is a
requirement for common look and feel with other applications that support google login."
2014-08-07T16:58:55Z,discuss,"This ability must be turned on via the Registry to have any effect.  Otherwise, secondaries will continue
to function as they do now.  It also must be opted into for each toolbar as secondaries in other toolbars
use the cogwheel dropdown.
Right aligned secondaries are placed to the right of the search button."
