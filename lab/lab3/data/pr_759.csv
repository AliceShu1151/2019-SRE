759,Disable rerunImportAction when it is performed on refreshProject
2018-03-14T19:57:02Z,discuss,"There is a ""Refresh Project"" button on the Build view, when this button
is pressed, the rerunImportAction action inside
ExternalSystemUtil#refreshProject is performed, but if you double click
this button, this action is performed twice."
2018-03-14T19:57:02Z,discuss,"This button is not disabled until the update method is called and inside it,
processHadles.isProcessTerminated() returns false. This causes a small
time window in wich this button can be cliicked multiple times."
2018-03-14T19:57:02Z,discuss,"This change disables this button when this action is performed instead
of waiting for update and isProcessTerminated to catch up."
