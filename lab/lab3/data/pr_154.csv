154,Fixes path so that local modules get priority
2014-02-23T02:59:30Z,discuss,By using sys.path.extend() the local source and content directories are given lower priority than the global python site-path. This can be problematic if the module being developed is also installed in the site-path.
2014-02-23T03:02:38Z,discuss,This patch will give priority to the local source and content directories. This way developers can test their modules while developing them.

It's a default starting command for Python Console and it can be changed in Python Console Settings ""Starting Script"". I don't think we should change it for all the users.
Thank you very much for your interest!"
