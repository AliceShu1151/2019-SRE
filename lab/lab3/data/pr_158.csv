2014-03-04T13:36:30Z,discuss,"If you have opinion that method signature should be changed or need to
call listener on each time using one configurable than let me know.
But I think that from performance perspective we need to have one call on all changes."
2014-03-04T13:36:30Z,discuss,"I pass id extension point to the listener for security reason to
prevent possible injection or mess. Because plugin in another case  will have access to
Configurable object itself which is possible security ""hole""."

registered listeners, please let me know also."

2018-07-25T07:22:43Z,discuss,However the suggested implementation works only if settings are changed via Settings dialog. But some settings may be changed by accessing the corresponding service via API (e.g. when user invokes an intention action) or when a project configuration is reimported from Maven/Gradle or reloaded from the configuration files after user updates the project from VCS. So it won't work reliably.
2018-07-25T07:22:43Z,discuss,"We have plans to create a unified model to store all settings, and it'll support notification about changes, but until it's done I think it's better to describe which specific setting you want to listen for changes, and we'll be able to provide a special listener for it which will work inside its service so all the cases will be supported."
