716,More detailed tests for UnnecessaryUnicodeEscapeInspection
2018-01-27T12:43:12Z,discuss,"I had been confused when I saw the do while loop in the code since it
looked like an obvious endless loop. Therefore I wrote some tests to
make sure this code is covered (which it already was before)."
2018-01-27T12:43:12Z,discuss,"Since extracting the escape sequences from the source code is
independent of reporting the errors, I extracted that code to its own
method, which made it easily testable on its own."

Sorry I have to decline this pull request. In my opinion this change makes the code harder to read than it already was. The increased tests I like, but I would prefer it if the existing test was just expanded instead. I hope you don't mind (I like your other pull requests:-)"
