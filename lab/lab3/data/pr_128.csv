IDEA-57875 No quick fix to create property from a usage of unknown property in Ant"
2013-11-13T03:37:24Z,discuss,"This brings back the features that were available in v9.
It should create a property as an xml tag in the current file or as a property if a build.properties exists.
If multiple build properties exist you get multiple intentions pop up as well as the option to just include it in the current file."
