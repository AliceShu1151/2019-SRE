1160,Change UI designer form compiler modality to any
2019-06-21T09:23:48Z,discuss,"I do not understand why the form compilation task referred to in this commit is requiring the application to have a non-modal state, as it seems to me this process can fulfill its job even if there is a modal dialog present. This PR changes the requirement to any modality state."
