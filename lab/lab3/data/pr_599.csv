599,simple support for xslt 3.0
2017-07-04T10:34:55Z,discuss,"While XSLT 3.0 offers much more functionality, the basic thing you want is that the IDE at least recognizes the same functionality as in 2.0. I think with these simple changes that should be fixed. Since I am not a Java developer, and also did not test this, you should take this PR with care."
