790,[PY-27594] disable debug when Python gets input from stdin
2018-05-13T17:03:02Z,discuss,See https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-27594 for more details. Resolves fabioz/PyDev.Debugger#103.
2018-05-13T17:03:02Z,discuss,"Note this is a workaround, as it will have the effect of not breaking things (as it does now). However, it will not allow users to debug library calls from within the stdin content."
2018-05-13T17:03:02Z,discuss,"If we could interpret the whole input, write it to a temp file, that would allow the user to debug. However, I think that will require a significant refactor of this monkey patching."
