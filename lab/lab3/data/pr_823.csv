823,"Add ""delete unversioned"" action shortcut in commit changes dialog"
2018-07-08T18:43:46Z,discuss,This PR fixes the https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-160857 issue.
2018-07-23T18:39:09Z,discuss,"Actually, I think, it's not quite OK to add ""DELETE"" shortcut to the ""ChangesView.DeleteUnversioned"" action, because it is enabled ""almost everywhere"" and will highly intersect with common ""$Delete"" action (though the implementation is quite the same)."
2018-07-23T18:39:09Z,discuss,"I'll make changes to use ""$Delete"" action instead of ""ChangesView.DeleteUnversioned"" (and so delete shortcut will also be available)."
2018-07-23T21:35:05Z,discuss,"If I've understood you correctly, I need to edit VcsActions.xml only."
2018-07-23T21:35:05Z,discuss,"If I do that, then I the delete icon disappears from the context menu.
Will it be ok?
