24,New highlights
2012-10-22T19:52:32Z,discuss,"As a former Eclipse user, I really miss highlights for abstract and inherited method calls.
That's why I wrote some code to have it working."
2012-10-22T19:52:32Z,discuss,"Implementing abstract method calls hightlights was trivial, but inherited method calls was a little harder as PsiMethod.getMethodReceiver() isn't giving expected information."
2012-10-22T19:52:32Z,discuss,Hope this helps.
2012-10-23T12:50:44Z,discuss,"Instead of all this code, please use enclosingClass.isInheritor(method.getContainingClass(), true)"
2012-10-23T12:51:03Z,discuss,"PsiTreeUtil.getParentOfType(element, PsiClass.class)"
2012-10-23T12:55:16Z,discuss,"This is wrong. You need to find a parent PsiMethodCallExpression for elementToHighlight, then get its method expression and check what kind of qualifier the method expression has."
