499,IDEA-165963 Gradle run configurations cannot be profiled
2016-12-27T16:09:16Z,discuss,Provide a way for executors other than the debugging executor to set VM parameters that are patched into the gradle Java task. This is solved with a special key that can be set in the user data of the ExecutionEnvironment.

However I've also renamed field DEBUGGER_SETUP_KEY and parameter debuggerSetup => JVM_AGENT_SETUP_KEY, jvmAgentSetup.
And added the validation to avoid misusage of the api: all JVM arguments should be started with ""-agentlib:"", ""-agentpath:"" or ""-javaagent:"""
