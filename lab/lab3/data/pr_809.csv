2018-06-20T02:00:03Z,discuss,I have signed the contributor license agreement now.
2018-06-25T21:45:26Z,discuss,"Thank you, but the fix you suggested is a bit tricky, I've fixed the problem in more obvious way (I believe)."
2018-06-27T18:59:08Z,discuss,"the reason i fixed it this way is because there are quite a few edge cases which just get fixed by ""resyncing"" the state. it would obviously be better to make sure that things are always kept in sync, but that would involve a much bigger change."
2018-06-27T18:59:08Z,discuss,All I do basically is ask for what the current window should be and then make sure that what should be the current window actually is focused.
2018-06-27T18:59:08Z,discuss,"I also tried getting to the bottom of why it ended up in an inconsistent state in the first place but I gave up after about an hour, because I just didn't have the time to chase after this."
2018-06-27T18:59:08Z,discuss,"In that sense this is rather a Hotfix, that (having run this for a few days now) has been working properly for me."
2018-07-21T10:03:54Z,discuss,"@lumie1337 thanks for the fix, the original issue has been fixed in master."
