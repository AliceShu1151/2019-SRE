310,Allow disabling HiDPI scaling with -Dhidpi=false
2015-10-22T06:50:51Z,discuss,This is a workaround for the issue described in IDEA-143854.
2015-10-22T06:50:51Z,discuss,"It allows having larger font size in IDEA (""Appearance > Override default fonts"") while keeping the icons at their original size (sharp!)."
2015-10-22T06:50:51Z,discuss,"It does so by short-circuiting calls to JBUI.setScaleFactor() in case -Dhidpi=false has been defined.
This brings setScaleFactor() in sync with calculateScaleFactor() behavior.
(And also prevents the splash-screen from lubberly changing the scale midway due to the call from LafManagerImpl.patchLafFonts())"
2015-10-22T06:50:51Z,discuss,"I've been using IDEA with this patch since the ""HiDPI build"". And haven't noticed any undesired effects."
