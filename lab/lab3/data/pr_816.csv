2018-07-30T12:45:40Z,discuss,"Thanks for the contribution! However the change doesn't work for me locally. Also the check for empty files of the configuration will not work if there are transitive dependencies.
I've added the fix of the issue using the following commit e7d2931
Please, let us know if it will not work for you."
