387,Field Declaration Order Fix for Fernflower
2016-04-21T21:37:07Z,discuss,This fixes an issue I had when decompiling an obfuscated class. (testData/classes/pkg/Class8.class).
2016-04-21T21:37:07Z,discuss,Fernflower did not properly order the fields in which the order they are initialized therefore causing the program to break.
2016-04-21T21:37:07Z,discuss,Ex:

2016-06-03T10:54:53Z,discuss,Please also add a test into SingleClassesTest with the corresponding .dec file (and preferably .java source).
2017-04-19T10:07:07Z,discuss,@Jonatino any updates on this?
2017-04-19T22:06:23Z,discuss,@gorrus I completely forgot about this. Looking at it now I bet there is a much more elegant solution. I will work on it soon.
2017-09-11T05:20:33Z,discuss,Any updates on this? It would be extremely helpful to have this fix merged in because it fixes a major issue that I'm dealing with and frustratingly I'm my restricted to only using master branches... @Jonatino @gorrus
2017-09-11T13:46:04Z,discuss,@ccarpenter04 I keep forgetting about this issue. I'll finish it within the next couple days. 
2017-09-11T16:34:03Z,discuss,"@Jonatino I'd really appreciate that, contact me if there's anyway that I can help. I've worked with the fernflower source in the past and have also signed the CLA here exclusively for making contributions to fernflower (although it's been a while)"
2017-09-12T15:55:17Z,discuss,@ccarpenter04 Do you have any example of .class files that current Fernflower doesn't sort fields in the order they are initialized in bytecode? Would help me with testing :)
